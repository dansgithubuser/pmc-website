<p style="font-weight: 400;">is coming to your device August 23-30!!</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The goal of Planet Music Camp is to keep our community connected until we can meet in person again. The theme for Planet Music Camp will develop organically – it will be fun to see what happens!</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Just to give you lots of warning, there will be NO virtual tuck time at Planet Music Camp. Astronaut food and Tang are available on Amazon, but the shipping charges would be a problem.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">DON’T DESPAIR – there are lots of other ideas on the virtual table. Right now, we are developing the most promising ideas, and on June 20 we will determine the activities to implement.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Starting in early July, we’ll be sending you information like:</p>
<ul>
<li>The schedule for Planet Music Camp;</li>
<li>Details about the platform(s) we will use;</li>
<li>Details (as available) about the activities and events;</li>
<li>Requests for email addresses so we can include you in events;</li>
<li>Information on how to register for virtual workshops so we’ll be sure to include you.</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We are bravely going where no Planet Music Camp Committee has gone before, and we are concerned about taking on too much, so there may not be the variety you are used to. We hope you will find something that excites you among the activities we’ll offer.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">You may also get phone calls or emails from workshop leaders with specific questions for you.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We’re excited about this adventure – we hope you’ll join us for the journey.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Your Planet Music Camp Planning Committee</p>

            <![CDATA[
                <p>You have probably heard the sad news already… there will be no in-person music camp in 2020. This hard decision was taken out of our hands by the Government of Ontario. They understand the importance of summer camps, but this year it just wasn’t safe to go ahead.</p>
<p>We have emailed all currently registered campers, and campers from 2017, 2018, and 2019, and also have a video message available:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.presbyterianmusiccamp.ca/this-year.html">https://www.presbyterianmusiccamp.ca/this-year.html</a></p>
<p>We understand that this will be very hard for our camp community. PMC is seen by many as the end of one year and the start of the next. You may be feeling angry), incredulous), or even a bit depressed. The PMC Committee shares these feelings (and many more), and we are still working on accepting that “camp” will be a different sort of experience this year.</p>
<p>However…there is a silver lining:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our friends at Camp Tamarack (Rick, Ellen, and Marc) are optimistic that they will<br>survive and thrive, and they are looking forward to hosting us again in 2021.</li>
<li>The PMC Committee will continue to work on the administrative issues (constitution,<br>charitable status, emergency procedures, and more) so we will be in great shape for<br>camp in 2021.</li>
<li>We have started thinking about some virtual activities for 2020 to keep our community<br>engaged and active. You’ll hear more about these as the plans develop.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, hold that time at the end of August, and watch for more news from us,</p>
<p>Your PMC Committee</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">Virtual meetings continue as we plan for PMC 2020. We remain committed to providing the best possible PMC experience, and are in close contact with Camp Tamarack, Cairn, and the Ontario Camps Association as we navigate this strange new world.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">You have recently received a request from our Deans, David Linderman and Hugh Donnelly, for volunteers for evening worship. If you are interested in leading an evening worship, please respond soon so David and Hugh can plan.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">And we still work away at the administrative issues: the Constitution for PMC, Emergency Procedures, and the Wiki.</p>

<div>One thing that would help the PMC committee in our discussions is knowing if you would attend PMC 2020 if the situation allows. With that in mind:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>If you intend to come to camp, please register right away so we will know our numbers</li>
<li>Please do NOT pay now</li>
<li>We are discussing our cancellation policy, and more information will be available soon</li>
<li>We all know that this situation is ongoing and so are our discussions. Our guiding principles are:
<ul>
<li>we want everyone to be healthy and safe; </li>
<li>we want to support our camp community during this time; </li>
<li>we want to maximize flexibility for decision making for everyone – our committee, our campers; and Tamarack; </li>
<li>we want Tamarack to make it through this; </li>
<li>we don’t want campers to suffer undue financial hardship; </li>

                <p style="font-weight: 400;"><u></u>The ABCs of planning camp:</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We have a Plan A and a Plan B so we can plan for COVID-19.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In <u>Plan A</u>, PMC goes ahead as scheduled. We continue to recruit leaders for workshops, draft schedules, and plan evening activities. COVID-19 will impact us to some extent, but our community can work with whatever restrictions the Muskoka Public Health Unit advises.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In <u>Plan B</u>, PMC will go on in a different way. We are still hoping to avoid this, but the optimism of 3 weeks ago is not as strong today. We plan to make a definite decision by the end of May – if the government doesn’t beat us to it!</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We are also making progress on the administrative issues related to our status as a Registered Charity.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">AND – we have a new Wiki (which I have learned comes from Hawaiian "wiki-wiki" which means "quick" – thanks Lois!). This resource will prevent the committee from reinventing the wheel as membership evolves.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">PMC is a community, and we are stronger together.  If you are coping with illness, job loss, financial burdens, separation, loneliness, anxiety, boredom, depression…know that we are with you in spirit and praying for you. We are all in this together!</p>

                <p>Neither snow, nor rain, nor heat, nor gloom of night shall keep your PMC committee from staying on schedule.</p>
<p>Most importantly, we confirmed that the camp dates will NOT be changed – PMC 2020 will be August 23-30 as planned.</p>
<p>The theme for 2020 is</p>
<p class="align-center"><em>The long and dusty road: exploring life as a pilgrimage</em></p>
<p>If you immediately thought of the road at Tamarack, you don’t need an illustration. Sub-themes will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pilgrimage in community</li>
<li>Pilgrimage that changes directions</li>
<li>Pilgrimage through the wilderness</li>
<li>Pilgrimage of baby steps</li>
<li>Pilgrimage of discipleship</li>
<li>Pilgrimage that we are never walking alone</li>
</ul>
<p>Stay tuned as we develop these themes.</p>
<p>The new website is very close to ready – in fact, by the time you get this the website will likely be operational. You will be redirected automatically from <a href="musicamp.ca">musicamp.ca</a> to the new site, <a href="presbyterianmusiccamp.ca">presbyterianmusiccamp.ca</a>. Check it out (and let us know if you find any issues – it’s a work in progress).</p>
<p>The new website won’t have 2020 fees until we finalize our HST plans and the Tamarack rates for 2020. We will have fees for 2020 available by the end of February (after our next meeting).</p>
<p>We spent time January 25 developing a draft schedule for PMC 2020. Your feedback on last year’s schedule was very helpful, and we are excited about some new workshops for 2020 – we just need to confirm leadership for all of these plans.</p>

                <p>Your PMC Committee met November 23 in beautiful Ashburn, Ontario.</p>
<p>We’re really excited about the theme for 2020; as soon as artwork is ready, we’ll let you all know.</p>
<p>A big project for the next few months is the PMC Website. We are going to redesign the website and update the content to make it more attractive to and informative for potential new campers. <strong>Daniel Eisner</strong> will be leading this, with content help from <strong>Rae-Lyn Rosefield</strong>, <strong>Kaitlin Audet</strong>, <strong>Cynthia McMinn</strong>, <strong>Bradley Audet</strong>, and <strong>Lindsay Weidelich</strong>.</p>
<p>We also discussed and approved a financial incentive for new campers – ½ price camp! There are some limits and conditions for this, but we wanted to tell you early so you can persuade your family and friends to think about coming to camp in 2020. More information will follow.</p>
<p><strong>Vic Lovatt</strong> has joined us as youth rep, <strong>Sarah Dupont</strong> is continuing work on scripts for promotional videos, and <strong>Anne Audet</strong> is looking into solving a cross-contamination issue for campers with food allergies/sensitivites.</p>
<p>Of course, we also discussed some more mundane things, like insurance,<br>safety plan, and the budget. Someone has to.</p>
<p>Finally, there is a great idea for fundraising in the works. Stay tuned for details of this – you won’t want to miss it.</p>

                <p>We are trying something new this year! After each committee meeting, we’ll send a brief summary to our camp community so you can see what we’re up to.</p>
<p>We had our first committee meeting on September 28. We welcomed several new PMC Committee members, and said thanks and farewell to a few others. Special thanks to our outgoing Deans, <strong>Sue Thompson</strong> and <strong>Kim Lovatt</strong>, and to our outgoing Convener <strong>Ruth Anne Robertson</strong>, as they transition to other (just as demanding) roles in their lives.</p>
<p class="align-center"><strong>Mark your calendars!! Camp in 2020 will be August 23-30.</strong></p>
<p>Welcome to <strong>David Linderman</strong> and <strong>Hugh Donnelly</strong> as Deans for 2020 and 2021. They have some great theme ideas – we’ll update you soon.</p>
<p>The <strong>PMC Committee</strong> for 2019-2020 is:<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Conveners</span>: Taras Broadhead and Cynthia McMinn<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Treasurer</span>: Debi Vanderstelt<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Secretary</span>: Alison Cooper<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Registrar</span>: Cathy Whiteside<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Merchandise</span>: Cathy Whiteside<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Staffing</span>: Jesse Fegelman and Kim Lovatt<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Advertising</span>: TBC<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Website</span>: Daniel Eisner<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Camp Liaison</span>: Anne Audet<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Teen</span> Rep: Lisa Broadhead<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cairn Reps</span>: MJ Perry, Doug Kendall</p>
<p>Among the many things we talked about at the meeting were these highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Planning is underway for new promotional videos for PMC, to use for introducing PMC to new campers. Sarah Dupont is working on scripts.</li>
<li>An improved agreement for <strong>sharing the Tamarack site</strong> with Camp Tournesol (the French camp); we are working on a plan to implement an improved agreement in 2020.</li>
<li>The future and role of <strong>Coffee House</strong>; we will consider this further as we plan for 2020.</li>
<li>We have the <strong>banner</strong> to fix over the winter (repairing the Great Mousecapade); Ian MacCready has the parts to fix the banner stand.</li>
</ul>
<p>Want to make a joyful noise over the winter? It’s not too late to get a djembe to practice on your own, or to add “grace notes” to your Sunday service – contact <strong>MJ Perry</strong> or any committee member for information.</p>
<p>Look for our next update in early December for more information on these and other topics, including a possible teen retreat in the New Year. AND watch for a picture in Presbyterian Connection (check <a href="https://presbyterian.ca/presbyterian-connection/">the PCC website</a> for details).</p>

                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The groundhog says we have to wait a while yet for camp, but we’re hard at work planning it for you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is progress on leadership and the schedule for PMC 2020, and we are starting to plan for the evening and Saturday afternoon events.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of our time was spent on getting our administrative house in order. There are "behind the scenes" issues that require some attention: things like our relationship with the CRA, our governance relationship with the national church, insurance coverage, and emergency procedures. In keeping with this year’s theme, it's </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">"a long and dusty road"</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to get these things updated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The teens are planning a retreat March 20/21/22 if enough people are available. Please RSVP ASAP so they can plan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some great news - the new website is active! Check it out at</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.presbyterianmusiccamp.ca">https://www.presbyterianmusiccamp.ca</a><a href="https://www.presbyterianmusiccamp.ca"></a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">or just let the internet redirect you. We want the new website to be a better source of year-round information, in addition to the current year’s theme and registration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And you can register while you’re there!! It only takes a couple of minutes and you can cross it off your 'to do' list. Register before May 15 for early bird prices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, you should be getting your receipts in the mail for donations made in 2018 and 2019. These will be from the Synod. </span></p>
