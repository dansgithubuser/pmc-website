<p><img class="post__image post__image--right" src="https://presbyterian-music-camp.github.io/website/media/posts/6/PMC-Stick-House.jpg" height="10em">The first time that I attended Presbyterian Music Camp I was ten years old. It was 1976, when the camp was still located at the United Church’s Golden Lake Camp. Music Camp had taken to using the last full week of August at the camp, after the young summer campers and their counselors had returned home to get ready for school. We were a little different: our camp included babies, young families, lots of teenagers, couples whose children had grown up and left home, single women in their sixties and seventies; everyone you might meet at your home church!</p>
<img class="post__image--left" src="https://presbyterian-music-camp.github.io/website/media/posts/6/Lost-Pilgrims.jpg" width="349" height="262">
<p>I don’t remember what the weather was like that year, but I do remember the music and the people. The whole camp worked together all week to present “Jonah-Man Jazz”. Alison Stewart-Patterson, one of the camp’s founders, conducted. I say conducted, but her conducting was more like a larger-than-life dance of joy! (She paid dearly for her extravagance later at a Kangaroo Court, when she had to sit perfectly still in a chair and conduct the camp choir with her pinky fingers. Ouch!) Costumes were created, backdrops were painted, music was practiced, and everyone participated in some way. I was a “wave”, along with a bunch of the other children, but I think I can still sing all of the songs. And while my mind was learning the music, my heart was beginning to learn about Christian community.</p>

<h2 id="mcetoc_1drk2mm2h2"><strong>The Teen Years</strong></h2>
<p><img class="post__image post__image--right" src="https://presbyterian-music-camp.github.io/website/media/posts/6/Erin-Brennan.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="262">Finally, I was in the teen cabin – the land of independence! Funny thing, though – we teens were still very much a part of the camp community; our families were with us, we sang in the camp choir as well as the teen choir, we participated in and even helped lead workshops, we did dishes (singing the whole time!), and we participated in the leadership of morning and evening devotions. We had our own space, but we really belonged in the larger group as well. Our musical role-models were amazing – gifted choral conductors, inspiring song-writers, talented vocalists and instrumentalists – but, more than their talent, these adults were people we respected for their kindness, patience, and their willingness to engage with us. What we learned along the way was that they were inspired by us as well; our energy, our raw talent, our eagerness to learn, our willingness to take risks, and the way we looked after each other and the younger children.</p>
<p>During my teens, Music Camp was the beginning of my year. I arrived excited to see my friends again and went home emotionally and spiritually renewed for another year at school and church.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1drk2o54u3"><strong>“The Adults Are Here”</strong></h2>
<p><img class="post__image post__image--left" src="https://presbyterian-music-camp.github.io/website/media/posts/6/PMC-Brass.jpg" alt="" width="349" height="466">You know you’re not one of the teens anymore when you go down to the campfire at night and someone says, “The adults are here.” Believe me, it comes as a surprise. I’m a little older now, but the same God-filled moments that awed me at camp when I was a teen still give a chill: singing pieces in the camp choir that you can only sing because you have a strength in numbers that most church choirs can only dream of, watching little ones fall asleep cuddled happily in the laps of teenagers they didn’t even know a week ago, walking back to the cabin at night by the light of the Milky Way or even the magical dancing of the aurora borealis, myriad impromptu concerts and, yes, singing by the campfire and laughing with friends well into the night. There are new God-filled moments as well: playing in the concert band with my teen-aged son, the odd calm moment sitting reading or watching the water while the kids are busy with their friends, meeting the children of the kids I used to teach in Children’s Choir, or chatting with old friends who still see the teenager inside me.</p>
<img class="post__image--right" src="https://presbyterian-music-camp.github.io/website/media/posts/6/IMG_8348-1024x683.jpg" width="350" height="233">
<p>Getting older isn’t all bad. Parents have the special gift of experiencing again some of the things they did when they were young through the eyes of their children. Now I get to watch my son play his beloved bass in the Garage Band, and my older daughter experience the crystalline beauty – and teamwork – of handbell playing. My younger daughter’s smile beams in the Children’s choir and she’s still thrilled by the idea that she gets to buy candy every day at the tuck shop. But my husband and I are still campers, too. He’s bought himself a lovely ukulele and knows enough chords to teach the beginner class. I sing and play my French horn, and have a (very secret) desire to sing with the Garage Band one day.</p>
<p>Some say they feel camp has started when they experience the Circle and the Flame Sunday evening, with the repeated “Ubi Caritas et Amor, Deus Ibi Est” (Where there is charity and love, there is God) and the lighting of the candles brought by each family to camp. It’s a “coming home” feeling. For me, it comes even earlier – with the grace at dinner. All of the chaos associated with getting three kids and assorted instruments packed, dropping the dog off at the kennel, arranging for house-sitting, planning workshops, etc, etc, is forgotten when we start to sing grace. I think it’s the first moment new campers start to suspect that this might be something different. Everyone is singing – really singing! Not quietly, but strongly – in many-part harmony. The music is beautiful, but this is the first sign of the coming together of this community in Christ.</p>
<p>The common threads that still bring us together at Music Camp each summer are a love of music and a desire to experience Christian community. There’s something about being in a loving community that opens your heart and changes your perspective. Seeing the wonderful musicians at camp could make me feel inadequate, but instead it inspires me to practice just a little harder. Seeing someone spend an afternoon teaching little kids how to use a fishing rod motivates me to be a little more patient. Seeing the perseverance of campers with health or mobility challenges encourages me never to give up. Hearing someone play banjo in the concert after learning for only a week energizes me to be more courageous. Experiencing the uniqueness that each new camper brings to camp reminds me that we all have sacred gifts and that Christ’s community is for everyone.</p>

<p class="align-left">Presbyterian Music Camp (PMC) is a family camp that gathers the third week of August in Muskoka, Ontario.</p>
<p>Campers find joy in a diversity of ways, but the common thread is the sense of support from the community.</p>
<p class="align-left">All programming at PMC is run by volunteers within the community.</p>

<p class="align-right"> </p>
<p class="align-right">PMC has something for every interest and skill level. Workshops include ukelele, choir, handbells, concert band, jazz band, garage band, and drum circle.</p>
<p class="align-right">Niche musical groups come together and perform at meals, evening programs, or find their own unique venue. PMC has seen barbershop quartets, brass and woodwind quintents, and performances that defy classification.</p>

<p class="align-right"> </p>
<p class="align-right">As a family camp, PMC's campers come in all ages. Programming, for the most part, invites all ages simultaneously. The result is a uniquely intergenerational environment, though our teens have a particularly strong subculture.</p>

            <![CDATA[
                <p dir="ltr">Presbyterian Music Camp is a week long family camp hosted in Muskoka once a year. We live as a community and spend the week focusing on growing in faith, as musicians, and as a family. The camp is open to people of all ages and walks of life. All meals are eaten together in a community, and dietary restrictions are accommodated. Although the camp is affiliated with the Presbyterian Church, the camp is open to all, regardless of religious affiliation, regardless if you have any religious belief at all. There are many secular and non-secular activities to partake in, and those who attend for purely musical reasons enjoy the community feel of the camp.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The week begins with welcoming old friends and new which is followed by a meditative opening ceremony. Each weekday has 5 workshop periods which enable you to sign up for a broad variety of lessons. The workshop leaders are your fellow campers! Some examples of workshop titles are listed below. Each day also includes morning and evening devotions, breakfast,  lunch, dinner and snacks. After dinner each evening a unique evening program is held. Look for examples of evening activities below.</p>
<p dir="ltr">People attending the camp can choose to live in a cabin either with family, friends or on their own. There is a teen cabin (aged 13 to 18), and a young adult cabin (aged 19 to 30s), and many smaller family and single cabins throughout the camp. One of the wonderful parts of the Presbyterian Music Camp community is the intergenerational activities, with the exception of child/teen workshops, anyone is welcome to join workshops. This means there is a diverse spread of knowledge and skills over decades of age differences and walks of life.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The camp is run fully by volunteers, the organising committee is made up of campers who meet throughout the year to plan various aspects of camp, handle finances, run registration, and make decisions about how the camp is run. The figure heads the week of camp are known as the Deans and are campers who have attended for several years (decades in most cases!), the deans choose a central theme which worship and devotions are based around. Often workshop leaders will pick music often to the theme. The workshop leaders are also fellow campers, these leaders plan in the weeks and months before camp to select music pieces, or workshop activities to run while at camp! There is a camp first-aider who is also attending the camp. While at camp, campers volunteer and are responsible for cleaning common areas and keeping the campus clean. Camp Tamarack comes with a paid kitchen staff who provide all meals and snacks, as well as a cleaning crew who clean bathrooms and showers, and paid lifeguards.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Are you…</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1drchpn740" dir="ltr">Looking to develop as a musician?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">We have all levels of workshops which appeal to everyone from beginner to advanced.  Workshops include Camp Choir, Advanced Choir, Teen Choir, Singing for non-singers, Guitar, Ukulele, Banjo, Bagpipes, Show Choir, Handbell choir, Concert Band, Jazz Band, Garage Band, Celtic Group, Strings Ensemble, Drum Circle, Swing Dancing, Salsa Dancing, Sound and Drama Improvisation. As well, some of the common evening activities that have been run in the past include Coffee House, Variety Night (talent show), Live Band Karaoke, Dance Night, Campfire Sing-a-longs. Check out this blog post about living in a musical community.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1drchpv491" dir="ltr">Looking to deepen and learn about your faith?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Living as a Christian community allows for conversations to be open about faith and religion and how that looks in campers’ individual lives. Although the camp is a Presbyterian camp, many Christians and non-Christians attend the camp. Workshops include Bible Study, and Contemporary Christian Music. Other activities include, Morning Worship, Evening Devotions. Check out this blog post about living in a spiritual community.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1drchq6542" dir="ltr">Wanting to spend time together as a young family?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Each year the camp welcomes people of all ages to attend, so young families will feel at home in at Presbyterian Music Camp. Workshops for children include Cherubs (1.5 to 5 year olds - while parents can attend workshops of their own), Parent and Tot, Children's Choir, Children's games, Crafts for Kids, and Sport of the Day. As well the camp is situated on a private lake where you can have some beach time with our fully qualified lifeguards. Check out this blog post about coming to camp with a young family.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1drchqet83" dir="ltr">About Camp Tamarack</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Camp Tamarack’s site is located north of Bracebridge in the heart of the Muskokas. The site boasts a private lake with a beach and docks, trained lifeguards, canoes and kayaks for use by campers, tennis and basketball courts, soccer field, campfire pits and forests. Buildings on site include a dining hall, large and small performance spaces, new bathroom facilities and private stalled showers, cabins with bunk beds hosting up to 10 music campers at a time. Some cabins are equipped with private bathrooms, and some of the cabins are newly renovated.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1drchqjg64" dir="ltr">A History of Presbyterian Music Camp</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Back in 1972 the first Music Camp was hosted as a one time event to introduce the new Presbyterian Book of Praise. The idea of the camp was for church organists to become familiar with the new music. Since it was decided to be held in summer the invite was opened to their families as well. Presbyterian Music Camp met that year at a camp on Golden Lake in the Ottawa Valley and it went so well that it was encouraged to be organized again for the following year, and subsequent to follow! This formed a new Christian community brought together by music! By 1990 the camp outgrew its previous site and moved to the current site at Camp Tamarack near Bracebridge, where it is hosted in the last full week of August each summer. The organising committee and staff is made up of dedicated volunteers. Check us out on Facebook and Instagram!</p>
