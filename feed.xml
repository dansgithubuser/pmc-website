<p>We have some news to share about PMC at Camp Tamarack. Tamarack has told us that they cannot rent to us in 2023. The PMC Board had word that we were at risk about 5 weeks ago, and Tamarack confirmed that on November 19.</p>
<p>Since getting the news, we have started work on an intensive site search, and the site search subcommittee is optimistic that we will have something in place for 2023. Be assured that the Board has every intention of us gathering together as a community for camp in our usual week in August 2023.</p>
<p>We have changed sites before, and survived (and flourished). But for many of you, the Tamarack site is all you know, and this will be a big change. We are focusing on the potential positives in all this. But with the time constraints, we may have to make compromises in some areas.</p>
<p>The site search committee membership is: Taras Broadhead, Marilyn Broadhead, Lindsay Weidelich, Cathy Whiteside, Anne Audet, Scott Cooper, and Ian MacCready.</p>
<p>The committee took a long list of rental camps and narrowed this down (by size, location, and facilities), to 22 camps to interview by phone. From these phone interviews, they have identified 2 fantastic sites to visit in the next two weeks.</p>
<p>We will have an update for you in early 2023. The PMC Board is having a rare December meeting because of the urgency of this task.</p>
<p>Remember always that the site is just a backdrop for the people and ideas that make PMC special. PMC is different now from what it was at Golden Lake, and it will change again as we adapt to a new site.</p>
<p>If you want to talk about the change and how it affects you or your family, please reach out to <a href="mailto:taras.broadhead@gmail.com">Taras Broadhead</a>, <a href="mailto:marilyn.broadhead@gmail.com">Marilyn Broadhead</a>, <a href="mailto:lindsay.weidelich@gmail.com">Lindsay Weidelich</a>, <a href="mailto:imaccready@maestropro.ca">Ian MacCready</a>, or the <a href="mailto:presbyterianmusiccamp@gmail.com">PMC email</a>. </p>

<p class="p3">The PMC Board met October 29, and we have so much to be thankful for:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">PMC 2022<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">Wasn’t it great to be back in person for camp??!! In some ways it felt like just a few weeks since we had been together. There was lots of time to hang out with family and friends, and renew relationships. Your feedback (positive and not so positive) is appreciated. We have reviewed it and will consider it more deeply as we prepare for PMC 2023.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">The 50<span class="s2">th </span>Anniversary Celebrations are over, but the Circle of Love song is a video on YouTube; click here for your dose of nostalgia.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">CHARITABLE STATUS<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">It’s official – we have our charitable status back! Thanks to the efforts of Doug Kendall and others, we filled in forms, talked to CRA, had one emergency board meeting at camp, and it’s finally done.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">This means you will get a charitable donation receipt for 2022 – BUT the receipt won’t include your auction donations, because you got (or will get) something for those.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">For those who held off making a donation until you could get a receipt, now is your chance; if you make a donation by the end of the year you will get a tax credit for 2022. (We don’t desperately need your donation, and it’s entirely up to you.) Contact the Treasurer for more info.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

                <p>PMC 2022 is booked at Tamarack from August 21-28. We are pulling out all the stops to make this an in-person, face-to-face, real live camp, because 2022 is the <a href="https://presbyterian-music-camp.github.io/website/50-years-of-harmony.html">50th anniversary</a> of PMC!<br><br>The theme of PMC 2022 theme is:</p>
<p class="align-center"><em>The Long and Dusty Road: Life as a Pilgrimage</em></p>
<p>We would appreciate if you <a href="https://presbyterian-music-camp.github.io/website/register.html">register</a> sooner rather than later to give us an idea of numbers. Read on for everything we know so far that might help you decide if you can come this year or not. If you want to come but can’t quite commit, please email the registrar (Cathy Whiteside, <a href="mailto:pmcregistrar@gmail.com">pmcregistrar@gmail.com</a>) so we know about you.</p>
<p>Vaccination for Covid-19 will be required for those aged 6 and up to attend PMC in 2022, except for those with medical exemptions. <span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">We have made this decision so that we can provide a camp and program you are used to, and to protect our community, particularly those who cannot be vaccinated yet.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">A vaccine is now available for children age 5 and under. A first dose is strongly encouraged, but is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> required (as it may not be possible for parents to schedule this before camp).</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Visitors to PMC</strong></span></p>
<p>As of June 23, we WILL be allowing visits to PMC. There are a few restrictions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Visitors must be fully vaccinated, following the requirements for all campers;</li>
<li>Avoid activities that might expose you to Covid in the week leading up to the visit;</li>
<li>Take a rapid test 5 days before the visit and again the day of the visit;</li>
<li>Plan to stay on site for the duration of your visit. (Leaving is discouraged, as it is for all campers.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Contact the registrar (Cathy Whiteside, <a href="mailto:pmcregistrar@gmail.com">pmcregistrar@gmail.com</a>), to make arrangements for your visit, especially if you will need accommodation, as space is limited.</p>
<p>If possible, arrange to come on Saturday, so you can hear the concert, eat a delicious lunch, enjoy the birthday party, and spend your savings on the auction!</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">This Year's Schedule</span></p>
<p>The schedule is almost done; you can find the almost final version <a href="https://presbyterian-music-camp.github.io/website/pmc week schedule 2022_combined_Aug10.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. Further changes will be announced AT CAMP.</p>

                <h1><strong>PMC 2022 </strong></h1>
<p>2 MONTHS TILL CAMP!!</p>
<p>Dates (in case you don’t know yet): <strong>August 21-28</strong></p>
<p><strong>Vaccination</strong><strong> </strong>for Covid-19 <u>will be required</u> to attend PMC in 2022 (with medical exemptions, of course). For children under 5: vaccination for this group is not yet approved in Canada. If vaccination becomes available for this group before camp, we’ll figure out how it applies.</p>
<p>We are thrilled to see large numbers of people registering for PMC; lots of returning campers and a number of new campers too! At this point, cabin space is very, very limited. If you requested a solo cabin for just yourself, but might be willing to share with one or two others, would you please email Cathy Whiteside at <a href="mailto:pmcregistrar@gmail.com">pmcregistrar@gmail.com</a> and let her know? You can even choose your cabin mate(s). Thanks in advance!</p>
<h2>Visitors</h2>
<p>Visitors WILL be permitted at camp (Hurray!) provided they:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are fully vaccinated</li>
<li>Can minimize possible exposure to Covid in the week before the visit</li>
<li>Have a negative rapid test 5 days before the visit and again the day of the visit</li>
<li>Plan to remain on site for the duration of the visit</li>
</ul>
<p>Contact Cathy Whiteside (<a href="mailto:pmcregistrar@gmail.com">pmcregistrar@gmail.com</a>) ahead of time to confirm arrangements for your visit.</p>
<p>Try to plan your visit for Saturday if possible – for the Concert, 50<sup>th</sup> Anniversary Birthday Party, and the Auction.</p>
<h2>New Camper Meet &amp; Greet</h2>
<p>If you are a new camper, or know someone who is new, make sure they know about the New Camper Meet &amp; Greet, on the first day of camp, probably right before dinner.</p>
<h2>Tuckets</h2>
<p>Inflation has hit PMC – tuckets will be $0.50 each this year. Prices of tuck items are being adjusted to reflect the new tucket price.</p>
<h1>Volunteers Needed</h1>
<p>Please send a message to <a href="mailto:presbyterianmusiccamp@gmail.com">presbyterianmusiccamp@gmail.com</a> if you can help with 1 or more of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>At Camp: Evening worship (one day), Teen counsellors, Bible Study</li>
<li>Transportation of things from Toronto to camp (merchandise, hand drums)</li>
<li>Board members for the 2022-2023 Board</li>
</ul>

<p>We’ll be scanning old camp photos at camp this year. Please curate your photos – bring the best, leave the rest – and please make a note of who is in the photo (if you remember). Photos can be scanned and given back at camp, or scann</p>

And if your children have grown up too fast and want to get their own emails, let us know – we can add them too. Send an email to Alison Cooper.</p>

                <h2>PMC 2022</h2>
<p>Theme: <strong>The Long and Dusty Road: Life as a Pilgrimage.</strong></p>
<p>Dates: <strong>August 21-28</strong></p>
<p><strong>Registration</strong> is open as of February 19! Register soon to take advantage of the early bird fee (adults $500, youth $300), and to give us an idea of numbers. Click <a href="https://presbyterian-music-camp.github.io/website/register.html">here</a> to go to the registration page.</p>
<p>If you want to come but can’t quite commit, email the registrar (Cathy Whiteside,<br><a href="#INTERNAL_LINK#/post/null">pmcregistrar@gmail.com</a>) so we know about you.</p>
<p><strong>Refund policy</strong> is on the <a href="https://presbyterian-music-camp.github.io/website/register.html">registration page</a>; we really hope that we won’t have to cancel camp because of Covid, but the refund policy covers that in case we do.</p>
<p>Right now, we don’t know if we will be able to have <strong>visitors</strong> to camp. Please be aware that you (or your friends) may not be able to come for the weekend this year, depending on the Covid situation. Check the website closer to camp for information about this.</p>
<p><strong>Vaccination</strong> for Covid-19 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">will be required</span> to attend PMC in 2022 (with medical exemptions, of course). We have made this decision so that we can provide a camp and program you are used to, and to protect our community, particularly those who cannot be vaccinated yet. More details about this later.</p>
<p>We’re starting to work on the <strong>program and schedule</strong> for 2022. If you’d like to lead a workshop, contact Jesse Fegelman at <a href="mailto:presbyterianmusiccamp@gmail.com">presbyterianmusiccamp@gmail.com</a> before he calls you!</p>
<h2>50 YEARS OF HARMONY</h2>
<p>The 50th Anniversary Committee has been hard at work planning special events to celebrate this milestone on our journey. Some events will happen at camp, but a few things are planned before camp:</p>
<h3>Kitchen Parties</h3>
<p>There are 3 parties in the planning stages so far – Ottawa Valley area, Kingston, and Toronto. Dates will be confirmed in early March.</p>
<h3>Auction</h3>
<p>We’re planning an auction as a FUNdraiser. Details and date (likely June) to be confirmed.</p>
<p>If you want to donate an item or service to be auctioned, please contact MJ at <a href="mailto:presbyterianmusiccamp@gmail.com">presbyterianmusiccamp@gmail.com</a> with the details. The plan is to deliver the item at camp in August, to avoid shipping charges.</p>
<h2>? ? ? ? ? ?</h2>
<p>Some <strong>questions</strong> for the camp history:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is your favourite Music Camp memory?</li>
<li>What is your favourite aspect of Music Camp? [i.e., workshop, activity, sport, etc., and<br>please be specific]</li>
<li>What else would you like to say about PMC?</li>
</ul>
<p>Many thanks for your input. We’d like to have your input by <strong>the end of March</strong>.</p>

<h2>Music Camp Memories Facebook Group</h2>
<p>Did you know this group exists? Are you in it? If you’re not, send a request to join. Someone is sure to let you in. And once you’re there, tell all your music camp friends (There are some great photos of people you might recognize when they were much younger – with different hairstyles – and classic clothes.)</p>
<h2>PMC Wear</h2>
<p>Advance orders for PMC Wear are now available, with a deadline of May 1. Consider this a part of your registration. The logo on all items will be embroidered with the 50th anniversary logo. Details <a href="PMC Wear, 2022.pdf">here</a>.</p>

            <![CDATA[
                <p>You didn’t miss the last summary – it never went out. So there’s LOTS to report in this summary, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>PMC 2022<br>
<ul>
<li>Theme</li>
<li>Dates</li>
<li>Fees</li>
<li>Registration</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>50th Anniversary of PMC</li>
<li>Photo Albums</li>
</ul>
<h2>PMC 2022</h2>
<p>The <strong>theme</strong> for PMC 2022 is <em><strong>The Long and Dusty Road: Life as a Pilgrimage</strong></em>.</p>
<p>PMC 2022 will be <strong>August 21-28</strong> at Camp Tamarack.</p>
<p>We will be raising <strong>registration fees</strong> a bit this year. In the pre-pandemic times, PMC absorbed the cost of HST on your camp fees. Sadly, we are at a stage where we have to raise fees so that we can continue this practice. HST will still be included in your fees, and the new fees are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adult early bird (until May 15): <strong>$500</strong></li>
<li>Adult regular (May 16-June 28): $525</li>
<li>Adult just-in-time (June 29 onwards): $550</li>
<li>Youth (4-12) anytime: <strong>$300</strong> (There’s no increase for youth fees – it isn’t their fault the registration is delayed…)</li>
</ul>
<p>Also note the <strong>change in dates</strong> for the second fee increase – to align with when we have to pay our installment to Tamarack.</p>
<p><strong>Registration</strong> will open in early March, and we have no idea what to expect this year! It would REALLY help us if you could register early (well before the deadline!) to take advantage of the early bird fee, and to give us an idea of our numbers. We don’t want to cancel camp, but we need ~106 campers to break even, and we have to decide in June if camp can go ahead. If you want to come but can’t quite commit, talk to the registrar (Cathy Whiteside, <a href="mailto:pmcregistrar@gmail.com">pmcregistrar@gmail.com</a>) so we know about you.</p>
<h2>50 YEARS OF HARMONY</h2>
<p>Hard to believe that PMC has been running for 50 years! We are planning some great things to mark this milestone, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kitchen parties in the months leading up to camp – if you want to host a kitchen party (doesn’t have to be in your kitchen!), contact MJ at <a href="mailto:presbyterianmusiccamp@gmail.com">presbyterianmusiccamp@gmail.com</a></li>
<li>A history of camp</li>
<li>A commissioned song</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s not too late to contribute your ideas for the celebration. Contact MJ at <a href="mailto:presbyterianmusiccamp@gmail.com">presbyterianmusiccamp@gmail.com</a> with your suggestions.</p>
<p>Part of this process includes sifting through a treasure trove if archival information – old brochures, photos, merchandise, other memorabilia. If you have something that fits here, contact MJ at <a href="mailto:presbyterianmusiccamp@gmail.com">presbyterianmusiccamp@gmail.com</a>.</p>
<h2>???</h2>
<p>We have misplaced the photo albums. If you have them, or know where they are, send a message to Alison Cooper (<a href="mailto:m.alison.cooper@gmail.com">m.alison.cooper@gmail.com</a>)</p>
