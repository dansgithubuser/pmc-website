                <p>To all the leaders of PMC Trinity for making our second virtual camp sing.</p>
<p>To all the behind-the-scenes people who ran tech, interference, and the ice cream machine.</p>
<p>To all the Board members, for your ongoing commitment to PMC.</p>
<p>AND to all the campers who continue to support PMC through these tough times.</p>
<p>After a well-deserved September off, the PMC Board met on October 23. Some of us were on Zoom, and some were together again. It felt great (and a bit odd) to see some folks live again.</p>
<p>We spent some time at our first Board meeting on feedback. We plan to develop some of the great ideas for camp 2022, but we have all agreed:</p>
<h4 id="mcetoc_1fj251ofa1" class="align-center">NO 3PEAT!</h4>
<p> </p>
<p>PMC 2022 is booked at Tamarack from August 21-28. We are pulling out all the stops to make this an IN-PERSON, F2F, real live camp, because…</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1fj252quk2" class="align-center">2022 is the</h3>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1fj253dpu3" class="align-center">50TH ANNIVERSARY</h2>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1fj253jfa4" class="align-center">of PMC</h3>
<p>PMC started in 1972, back when the summer and winter Olympics were in the same year. The same year that Watergate began.</p>
<p>There is an Anniversary Sub-committee brainstorming ideas for this celebration. Contact MJ if you’d like to help, with the subject line PMC - 50 years of harmony (<a href="mailto:m.j.perry@mac.com">m.j.perry@mac.com</a>)</p>
<p>Introducing your (mostly the same) Board for 2021-2022</p>

<h3 id="mcetoc_1f6s5h38d1"><strong>The</strong> bad<strong> news</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is so hard to send this message…</span></p>
<p>Once again, we are in the position of having to cancel an in-person camp for 2021. We make this heart-rending decision for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our program does not lend itself to cohorting to reduce transmission. Mask wearing and physical distancing would make our program even more difficult.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We would have to give up too much of what makes camp special to us – like singing.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of our community members may not be able to attend at all, because</span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">they live in congregant settings where the rules prohibit their attendance;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">they are at higher risk because of age or medical condition; </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">they may not have had both doses of vaccine (or any doses, in the case of children).</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please know that we all wrestled with this decision, and we are fully aware of the implications this has for all of you. We are deeply sorry that we have to do this. The bottom line is that your health and well-being are too important to risk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve prepared a short video to give a few more details of this decision. Click <a href="https://youtu.be/7VR3TWPLIqY">here</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the video.</span></p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1f6s5k1oi2">The good news</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virtual camp </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">will</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> happen August 22-29. We are in the early planning stages for this, but we have last year’s experience to build on. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And this is where we need </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">your</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> help. If you:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have ideas for what we can do differently this year, or what we should repeat</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Want to lead a workshop or special event</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Want to help with the planning</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We want to hear from </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">you</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">!!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Send a message to </span><a href="mailto:m.alison.cooper@gmail.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">m.alison.cooper@gmail.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to let us know what you’d like to do.</span></p>

<h3 id="mcetoc_1f3ip3ccu6">Camp 2021</h3>
<p>There’s been another meeting of OCA camps, but still no official answer on in-person camps this summer, and we don’t know when that answer might be coming.</p>
<p>The PMC Covid Implications Working group has begun discussing our plans for the summer of 2021 in a Covid environment. While the news this week was not good (in fact, terrible), we are still preparing for an in-person camp in August. BUT, we are also thinking about what a virtual camp might look like this year, and how we can build on the lessons learned in August 2020.</p>
<p>If you have ideas for a virtual camp this year, we’d love to hear from you!!</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1f3ip60178">Inclusion at PMC</h3>
<p>Like many other camps, we have started a conversation about inclusion and how we can make it more obvious to potential campers that we are an inclusive community – in all areas where inclusion matters. Some of the things we are planning are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A more explicit welcoming statement on our website and in other materials</li>
<li>A covenant for campers to outline what we expect at camp</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have ideas how the PMC community can be more inclusive in ANY area, please get in touch with us. Lois Rooney-Giurin is steering this project (<a href="mailto:loisrg@outlook.com">loisrg@outlook.com</a>).</p>

<p>There’s been lots of talk in the news about opening camps this summer, but still no official answer. The OCA town hall on March 1 reinforced that there is no decision yet, but there IS lots of guidance on what we might have to do.</p>
<p>We spent time at our meeting on March 20 talking about what makes camp so special – this will help us to decide where we draw the line on changing our program to meet the guidelines (whatever the guidelines end up being).</p>
<p>The PMC Board also struck a working group to look at our programs and the guidelines in preparation for some further discussion over the next 2 months.</p>

<p>Your PMC Board has its first meeting of 2021 on January 23 – by Zoom, of course. The meeting was well attended by people, cats, and parrots.</p>
<p>Once again, here are the highlights…</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1esu9ogan1">Planet Music Camp Survey</h3>
<p>Many thanks to those who responded. We’ve considered how to incorporate your feedback into future camps.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1esu9paue3">HELP!</h3>
<p>If you were a person who suggested a workshop or wanted to help on the Board, THANK YOU – but now we need to know who you are! Send a message to Cynthia McMinn (clmcminn1996@gmail.com).</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1esu9qsbp5">Spring Event</h3>
<p>We want to do another on-line event!! Yes you heard right; we are planning something for late April/early May, this time to showcase all the great things we’ve been doing musically this year. Start thinking about what you’d like to contribute – more details coming next month.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1esu9qps14">Camp 2021</h3>
<p>We’ve done the first draft of a schedule for August 2021 – next up is some early staffing arrangements, based on 2020 to start. If you agree to do something in 2020, you will probably hear from…</p>

<p>2021 has to be better than 2020, right? With that hope, we are in the early stages of planning – for sure there will be something, just not sure yet what that might look like – and it will be a while before we know. More in the New Year.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1esnskjg45">Final Summary for 2020</h3>
<p>This will be the final summary for 2020. The Board wishes you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!</p>

                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We had another successful Zoom meeting on November 14 – here are the highlights…</span></p>
<p><strong>Christmas Campfire Karaoke</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mark </span><strong>December 21</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on your agenda for a Zoom Christmas special combining the magic of campfire and the fun of karaoke. Various workshop will do sing-a-long versions of Christmas songs and carols. AND if your family wants to contribute a Christmas song or story, you have until </span><strong>December 16 </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">to send your video to Jesse Fegelman (</span><a href="mailto:jesse.fegelman@gmail.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">jesse.fegelman@gmail.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). Maximum of 1 video per family, please.</span></p>
<p><strong>Discord</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We love Discord so much that we want to use it year round!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Discord has been updated, and we encourage you to check it frequently and to use it for planning events (including impromptu get-togethers with PMC friends).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can set up notifications on Discord – and the notifications can be specific to the channels you want to follow. The instructions are a little different for each type of device, but somewhere in the channel settings, or the Discord settings, there will be a place to set up notifications. Be sure you have notifications ON for the Announcements channel to prevent FOMO.</span></p>
<p><strong>Terms of Reference and Constitution</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the time you get this, the Synod of Central, Northeastern Ontario and Bermuda will have approved our new Terms of Reference. And the draft Constitution is ready for legal review.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s Changing?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the new Terms of Reference, we will report directly to the Synod (a division of the Presbyterian Church in Canada), rather than through the Cairn group of camps, as we did for the past few years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our draft constitution provides for a Board of Directors, rather than a camp committee. It also spells out how many Directors we need for a quorum, the rules for calling meetings, and voting at meetings. This will provide a structure for decision-making, particularly when there are challenging decisions on the table.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What stays the same?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pretty much everything else – our Mission Statement; what you see, hear and feel at camp; our community. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your PMC Board</span></p>
