                <p style="font-weight: 400;">The PMC Committee spent time over the past 2 weeks creating a video! Check out our results at:</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://youtu.be/0ALK-clfcRA" >https://youtu.be/0ALK-clfcRA</a></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Virtual meetings continue as we plan for PMC 2020. We remain committed to providing the best possible PMC experience, and are in close contact with Camp Tamarack, Cairn, and the Ontario Camps Association as we navigate this strange new world.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">You have recently received a request from our Deans, David Linderman and Hugh Donnelly, for volunteers for evening worship. If you are interested in leading an evening worship, please respond soon so David and Hugh can plan.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">And we still work away at the administrative issues: the Constitution for PMC, Emergency Procedures, and the Wiki.</p>

<div> </div>
<div>One thing that would help the PMC committee in our discussions is knowing if you would attend PMC 2020 if the situation allows. With that in mind:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>If you intend to come to camp, please register right away so we will know our numbers</li>
<li>Please do NOT pay now</li>
<li>We are discussing our cancellation policy, and more information will be available soon</li>
<li>We all know that this situation is ongoing and so are our discussions. Our guiding principles are:
<ul>
<li>we want everyone to be healthy and safe; </li>
<li>we want to support our camp community during this time; </li>
<li>we want to maximize flexibility for decision making for everyone – our committee, our campers; and Tamarack; </li>
<li>we want Tamarack to make it through this; </li>
<li>we don’t want campers to suffer undue financial hardship; </li>
<li>we want PMC to survive and thrive.</li>

                <p style="font-weight: 400;"><u></u>The ABCs of planning camp:</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We have a Plan A and a Plan B so we can plan for COVID-19.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In <u>Plan A</u>, PMC goes ahead as scheduled. We continue to recruit leaders for workshops, draft schedules, and plan evening activities. COVID-19 will impact us to some extent, but our community can work with whatever restrictions the Muskoka Public Health Unit advises.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In <u>Plan B</u>, PMC will go on in a different way. We are still hoping to avoid this, but the optimism of 3 weeks ago is not as strong today. We plan to make a definite decision by the end of May – if the government doesn’t beat us to it!</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We are also making progress on the administrative issues related to our status as a Registered Charity.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">AND – we have a new Wiki (which I have learned comes from Hawaiian "wiki-wiki" which means "quick" – thanks Lois!). This resource will prevent the committee from reinventing the wheel as membership evolves.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">PMC is a community, and we are stronger together.  If you are coping with illness, job loss, financial burdens, separation, loneliness, anxiety, boredom, depression…know that we are with you in spirit and praying for you. We are all in this together!</p>

                <p>Neither snow, nor rain, nor heat, nor gloom of night shall keep your PMC committee from staying on schedule.</p>
<p>Most importantly, we confirmed that the camp dates will NOT be changed – PMC 2020 will be August 23-30 as planned.</p>
<p>The theme for 2020 is</p>
<p class="align-center"><em>The long and dusty road: exploring life as a pilgrimage</em></p>
<p>If you immediately thought of the road at Tamarack, you don’t need an illustration. Sub-themes will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pilgrimage in community</li>
<li>Pilgrimage that changes directions</li>
<li>Pilgrimage through the wilderness</li>
<li>Pilgrimage of baby steps</li>
<li>Pilgrimage of discipleship</li>
<li>Pilgrimage that we are never walking alone</li>
</ul>
<p>Stay tuned as we develop these themes.</p>
<p>The new website is very close to ready – in fact, by the time you get this the website will likely be operational. You will be redirected automatically from <a href="musicamp.ca">musicamp.ca</a> to the new site, <a href="presbyterianmusiccamp.ca">presbyterianmusiccamp.ca</a>. Check it out (and let us know if you find any issues – it’s a work in progress).</p>
<p>The new website won’t have 2020 fees until we finalize our HST plans and the Tamarack rates for 2020. We will have fees for 2020 available by the end of February (after our next meeting).</p>
<p>We spent time January 25 developing a draft schedule for PMC 2020. Your feedback on last year’s schedule was very helpful, and we are excited about some new workshops for 2020 – we just need to confirm leadership for all of these plans.</p>

                <p>Your PMC Committee met November 23 in beautiful Ashburn, Ontario.</p>
<p>We’re really excited about the theme for 2020; as soon as artwork is ready, we’ll let you all know.</p>
<p>A big project for the next few months is the PMC Website. We are going to redesign the website and update the content to make it more attractive to and informative for potential new campers. <strong>Daniel Eisner</strong> will be leading this, with content help from <strong>Rae-Lyn Rosefield</strong>, <strong>Kaitlin Audet</strong>, <strong>Cynthia McMinn</strong>, <strong>Bradley Audet</strong>, and <strong>Lindsay Weidelich</strong>.</p>
<p>We also discussed and approved a financial incentive for new campers – ½ price camp! There are some limits and conditions for this, but we wanted to tell you early so you can persuade your family and friends to think about coming to camp in 2020. More information will follow.</p>
<p><strong>Vic Lovatt</strong> has joined us as youth rep, <strong>Sarah Dupont</strong> is continuing work on scripts for promotional videos, and <strong>Anne Audet</strong> is looking into solving a cross-contamination issue for campers with food allergies/sensitivites.</p>
<p>Of course, we also discussed some more mundane things, like insurance,<br>safety plan, and the budget. Someone has to.</p>
<p>Finally, there is a great idea for fundraising in the works. Stay tuned for details of this – you won’t want to miss it.</p>

            <![CDATA[
                <p>We are trying something new this year! After each committee meeting, we’ll send a brief summary to our camp community so you can see what we’re up to.</p>
<p>We had our first committee meeting on September 28. We welcomed several new PMC Committee members, and said thanks and farewell to a few others. Special thanks to our outgoing Deans, <strong>Sue Thompson</strong> and <strong>Kim Lovatt</strong>, and to our outgoing Convener <strong>Ruth Anne Robertson</strong>, as they transition to other (just as demanding) roles in their lives.</p>
<p class="align-center"><strong>Mark your calendars!! Camp in 2020 will be August 23-30.</strong></p>
<p>Welcome to <strong>David Linderman</strong> and <strong>Hugh Donnelly</strong> as Deans for 2020 and 2021. They have some great theme ideas – we’ll update you soon.</p>
<p>The <strong>PMC Committee</strong> for 2019-2020 is:<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Conveners</span>: Taras Broadhead and Cynthia McMinn<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Treasurer</span>: Debi Vanderstelt<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Secretary</span>: Alison Cooper<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Registrar</span>: Cathy Whiteside<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Merchandise</span>: Cathy Whiteside<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Staffing</span>: Jesse Fegelman and Kim Lovatt<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Advertising</span>: TBC<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Website</span>: Daniel Eisner<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Camp Liaison</span>: Anne Audet<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Teen</span> Rep: Lisa Broadhead<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cairn Reps</span>: MJ Perry, Doug Kendall</p>
<p>Among the many things we talked about at the meeting were these highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Planning is underway for new promotional videos for PMC, to use for introducing PMC to new campers. Sarah Dupont is working on scripts.</li>
<li>An improved agreement for <strong>sharing the Tamarack site</strong> with Camp Tournesol (the French camp); we are working on a plan to implement an improved agreement in 2020.</li>
<li>The future and role of <strong>Coffee House</strong>; we will consider this further as we plan for 2020.</li>
<li>We have the <strong>banner</strong> to fix over the winter (repairing the Great Mousecapade); Ian MacCready has the parts to fix the banner stand.</li>
</ul>
<p>Want to make a joyful noise over the winter? It’s not too late to get a djembe to practice on your own, or to add “grace notes” to your Sunday service – contact <strong>MJ Perry</strong> or any committee member for information.</p>
<p>Look for our next update in early December for more information on these and other topics, including a possible teen retreat in the New Year. AND watch for a picture in Presbyterian Connection (check <a href="https://presbyterian.ca/presbyterian-connection/">the PCC website</a> for details).</p>

                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The groundhog says we have to wait a while yet for camp, but we’re hard at work planning it for you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is progress on leadership and the schedule for PMC 2020, and we are starting to plan for the evening and Saturday afternoon events.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of our time was spent on getting our administrative house in order. There are "behind the scenes" issues that require some attention: things like our relationship with the CRA, our governance relationship with the national church, insurance coverage, and emergency procedures. In keeping with this year’s theme, it's </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">"a long and dusty road"</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to get these things updated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The teens are planning a retreat March 20/21/22 if enough people are available. Please RSVP ASAP so they can plan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some great news - the new website is active! Check it out at</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.presbyterianmusiccamp.ca">https://www.presbyterianmusiccamp.ca</a><a href="https://www.presbyterianmusiccamp.ca"></a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">or just let the internet redirect you. We want the new website to be a better source of year-round information, in addition to the current year’s theme and registration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And you can register while you’re there!! It only takes a couple of minutes and you can cross it off your 'to do' list. Register before May 15 for early bird prices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, you should be getting your receipts in the mail for donations made in 2018 and 2019. These will be from the Synod. </span></p>

            <![CDATA[
                <h2 id="mcetoc_1duqtp0m27"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Food</span></h2>
<p><strong>Are all of my meals and snacks included?</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> For the most part, yes! Your camper fees include all 3 meals each day, plus a morning and evening snack. The only snack not included is afternoon tuck, when a variety of snacks and drinks are available to purchase; all proceeds from tuck go to the Alison Stewart-Patterson fund, to help campers who can’t afford to pay the full camp fee.</span></p>
<p><strong>Is the food actually good? </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">YES! Most meals include a few options, so even the pickiest eaters should be satisfied!</span></p>
<p><strong>I have allergies/dietary restrictions; can these be accommodated?</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Yes, Camp Tamarack will do as much as possible to accommodate allergies and dietary restrictions. The kitchen staff at Tamarack are used to dealing with different allergies and dietary needs throughout the summer, so they should be able to keep you well fed through the week. In addition, the camp kitchen is a nut-free facility, so those with nut allergies should not need to worry. If you have dietary needs please note them on your registration form, or contact the registrar to discuss your needs further. If you have very severe food allergies or multiple dietary restrictions and wish to bring some of your own food, a fridge is available in the dining hall for storage; just make sure everything is very clearly labeled with your name.</span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1duqtojbu5"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accommodations and Camp Site</span></h2>
<p><strong>What are the cabins like? </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are several different styles of cabins at Camp Tamarack. Most of the cabins available are large dormitory-style units that would usually sleep about 16 campers (per side) on bunk beds during Tamarack’s regular summer program. We usually assign one family to each side of these cabins so there’s plenty of space. Most of these larger cabins do have a wall to divide each side, but some of the older cabins may not; if there’s no dividing wall we try to be mindful of assigning those cabins to families who either know each other or have asked to share a large cabin together. All of the cabins have electricity, and some of these larger cabins have toilets and sinks as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the dormitory-style cabins, there are also smaller cabins available that are used by Tamarack staff through most of the summer. These cabins range from 2 – 6 person cabins with bunk beds to cabins with a single or double bed that only sleep 1 – 2 people. All of these cabins have electricity, as well as a variety of potential bathroom set ups: some of these cabins have a toilet and sink, some have a full bathroom with shower, and some have neither. These cabins are usually assigned to couples or campers who come to PMC without other immediate family members.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is also a site for any campers who wish to bring their own tent or trailer for the week, but please note there are no service hookups available.</span></p>
<p><strong>Do I have to stay with my family?</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If you’re under the age of 13 (and won’t turn 13 before the end of the calendar year), then yes, you will need to stay with the parent or guardian who is with you at camp. For campers aged 13 – 19 we have male and female teen cabins available. For campers 18 and older, male and female young adults cabins are also available.</span></p>
<p><strong>What if my cabin doesn’t have a washroom or shower? </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are washrooms and shower houses in several locations across the camp site, so no one should have to go far to find facilities. Shower houses have been renovated in recent years to provide single person shower stalls and changing spaces.</span></p>
<p><strong>Is the site accessible? </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Camp Tamarack site is spread out and there is a fair amount of walking required. That being said, many campers bring their bicycles to get around more quickly, and campers with mobility issues do sometimes chose to drive themselves from one end of the site to the other.</span></p>
<p><strong>What other amenities are available at Camp Tamarack? </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the sleeping cabins and dining hall, Camp Tamarack has multiple program buildings that PMC uses for our workshops and morning and evening programs. The camp site also has a large beach front and swimming dock, soccer and baseball fields, and plenty of natural space to enjoy.</span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1duqto2in4"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Program</span></h2>
<p><strong>Do I have to take a workshop in every period?</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Absolutely not! Some campers like to sign up for 5 workshops and have a full day, other campers take just a few of their favourite workshops, and some campers come just to enjoy being in the natural setting and spending time with friends and family. It’s entirely up to you how many workshops you want to take.</span></p>
<p><strong>Can I take different workshops on different days?</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> No, unless a workshop is specifically organized as a “drop in” (like crafts), most of the workshops offered are designed to build each day, so dropping in for just one day is discouraged. Of course, if you sign up for a workshop and find that it isn’t the right fit after one or two days don’t force yourself to stay; this just means you’ll end up with a free period, which isn’t always the worst thing!</span></p>
<p><strong>What about programming for kids? </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are lots of options for our younger campers. Each morning children’s choir and children’s games are available (usually for ages 6 – 12), and in the afternoon there are a number of beginner-level workshops, crafts, and swimming to keep everyone busy. For our youngest campers (up to age 5) a program is available through the morning with music, games, and other activities.</span></p>
<p><strong>Do I have to participate in the camp-wide activities?</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> We encourage all campers to fully participate in order to get the full PMC experience and integrate into our community, but attendance at activities like devotions and evening program is not mandatory. If you chose not to attend a camp-wide scheduled activity we do ask that you not create a disruption for those who are taking part.</span></p>
<p><strong>I’m not Presbyterian; is that okay?</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> YES! PMC is a welcoming environment for members of any faith, campers who might be questioning their faith, or campers who do not have any religious affiliation. Our camp is Christ-centered, and there are religious aspects to every day at camp, but this doesn’t preclude anyone from coming to PMC.  We have some traditions that aren’t strictly Presbyterian, but if you’re new to camp or not familiar we are happy to fill you in!</span></p>
<p><strong>Someone in my family has special needs; can they still come to camp? </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Absolutely. PMC has had several campers with various special needs and they have always been included in our community. If a camper has special needs that require assistance (such as a full-time caregiver) they will need to bring someone to camp with them to help, and that person will need to register and pay for PMC; bursary help may be available to help cover the cost of a care-giver for a camper with special needs.</span></p>
<p><strong>Is the camp LGBTQ-friendly? </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes. Everyone is welcome at camp, we are completely inclusive. We also ensure that a gender-neutral washroom and showers are available.</span></p>
<p><strong>I don’t know if my musical skills are good enough; should I come to camp? </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">We would love to have you at PMC, no matter your musical skill level. We have campers who are professional musicians, music teachers, and choir directors, campers who are just learning to read music or have picked up an instrument for the first time, and campers who can’t carry a tune but love listening to music and being in a musical environment. All are welcome and all have a place at PMC. While most of our workshops are music-focused we do have several options every day that are non-musical as well, so don’t let this stop you from coming! For our musical workshops we offer a variety of skill levels, so everyone from beginners to advanced musicians will have somewhere that they fit in.</span></p>
<p><strong>I found PMC online and want to come, but I won’t know anyone! </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not to toot our own horns, but we are very welcoming! Everyone was a new camper at one time, whether they came with a parent or friend or just thought PMC sounded great and came by themselves. There’s a place for everyone at camp, and new campers have always found a group to socialize with.</span></p>
<p><strong>Is there any financial assistance available?</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> We have 2 bursary funds available to help campers who need financial assistance. The Alison Stewart-Patterson fund offers a bursary to cover about half of the camper fees for any camper who is not able to pay the full amount. The Tom Gemmell Bursary fund is available to cover the camper fees of one member of the clergy or certified student, and one music director each year. More information about these funds, as well as guidance on how to apply, is available on the <a href="https://presbyterian-music-camp.github.io/website/register.html">registration page</a>.</span></p>

                <p>We've recently started a community blog. A blog can have many valuable aspects, but our initial focus is how it can serve potential campers. In particular, we want to give deeper insight into the community for people who are considering going to camp for the first time. A listing of blog posts follows.</p>
