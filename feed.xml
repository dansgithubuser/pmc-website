<h3 id="mcetoc_1f6s5h38d1"><strong>The</strong> bad<strong> news</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is so hard to send this message…</span></p>
<p>Once again, we are in the position of having to cancel an in-person camp for 2021. We make this heart-rending decision for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our program does not lend itself to cohorting to reduce transmission. Mask wearing and physical distancing would make our program even more difficult.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We would have to give up too much of what makes camp special to us – like singing.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of our community members may not be able to attend at all, because</span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">they live in congregant settings where the rules prohibit their attendance;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">they are at higher risk because of age or medical condition; </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">they may not have had both doses of vaccine (or any doses, in the case of children).</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please know that we all wrestled with this decision, and we are fully aware of the implications this has for all of you. We are deeply sorry that we have to do this. The bottom line is that your health and well-being are too important to risk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve prepared a short video to give a few more details of this decision. Click <a href="https://youtu.be/7VR3TWPLIqY">here</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the video.</span></p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1f6s5k1oi2">The good news</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virtual camp </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">will</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> happen August 22-29. We are in the early planning stages for this, but we have last year’s experience to build on. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And this is where we need </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">your</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> help. If you:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have ideas for what we can do differently this year, or what we should repeat</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Want to lead a workshop or special event</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Want to help with the planning</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We want to hear from </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">you</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">!!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Send a message to </span><a href="mailto:m.alison.cooper@gmail.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">m.alison.cooper@gmail.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to let us know what you’d like to do.</span></p>

<h3 id="mcetoc_1f3ip3ccu6">Camp 2021</h3>
<p>There’s been another meeting of OCA camps, but still no official answer on in-person camps this summer, and we don’t know when that answer might be coming.</p>
<p>The PMC Covid Implications Working group has begun discussing our plans for the summer of 2021 in a Covid environment. While the news this week was not good (in fact, terrible), we are still preparing for an in-person camp in August. BUT, we are also thinking about what a virtual camp might look like this year, and how we can build on the lessons learned in August 2020.</p>
<p>If you have ideas for a virtual camp this year, we’d love to hear from you!!</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1f3ip60178">Inclusion at PMC</h3>
<p>Like many other camps, we have started a conversation about inclusion and how we can make it more obvious to potential campers that we are an inclusive community – in all areas where inclusion matters. Some of the things we are planning are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A more explicit welcoming statement on our website and in other materials</li>
<li>A covenant for campers to outline what we expect at camp</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have ideas how the PMC community can be more inclusive in ANY area, please get in touch with us. Lois Rooney-Giurin is steering this project (<a href="mailto:loisrg@outlook.com">loisrg@outlook.com</a>).</p>

<h3 id="mcetoc_1f1e6b4aa0">Camp 2021</h3>
<p>There’s been lots of talk in the news about opening camps this summer, but still no official answer. The OCA town hall on March 1 reinforced that there is no decision yet, but there IS lots of guidance on what we might have to do.</p>
<p>We spent time at our meeting on March 20 talking about what makes camp so special – this will help us to decide where we draw the line on changing our program to meet the guidelines (whatever the guidelines end up being).</p>
<p>The PMC Board also struck a working group to look at our programs and the guidelines in preparation for some further discussion over the next 2 months.</p>

We are starting a long-term project to make these more accessible than a box in someone’s basement.</p>

<p>Your PMC Board has its first meeting of 2021 on January 23 – by Zoom, of course. The meeting was well attended by people, cats, and parrots.</p>
<p>Once again, here are the highlights…</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1esu9ogan1">Planet Music Camp Survey</h3>
<p>Many thanks to those who responded. We’ve considered how to incorporate your feedback into future camps.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1esu9paue3">HELP!</h3>
<p>If you were a person who suggested a workshop or wanted to help on the Board, THANK YOU – but now we need to know who you are! Send a message to Cynthia McMinn (clmcminn1996@gmail.com).</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1esu9qsbp5">Spring Event</h3>
<p>We want to do another on-line event!! Yes you heard right; we are planning something for late April/early May, this time to showcase all the great things we’ve been doing musically this year. Start thinking about what you’d like to contribute – more details coming next month.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1esu9qps14">Camp 2021</h3>
<p>We’ve done the first draft of a schedule for August 2021 – next up is some early staffing arrangements, based on 2020 to start. If you agree to do something in 2020, you will probably hear from…</p>

                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We had another successful Zoom meeting on November 14 – here are the highlights…</span></p>
<p><strong>Christmas Campfire Karaoke</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mark </span><strong>December 21</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on your agenda for a Zoom Christmas special combining the magic of campfire and the fun of karaoke. Various workshop will do sing-a-long versions of Christmas songs and carols. AND if your family wants to contribute a Christmas song or story, you have until </span><strong>December 16 </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">to send your video to Jesse Fegelman (</span><a href="mailto:jesse.fegelman@gmail.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">jesse.fegelman@gmail.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). Maximum of 1 video per family, please.</span></p>
<p><strong>Discord</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We love Discord so much that we want to use it year round!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Discord has been updated, and we encourage you to check it frequently and to use it for planning events (including impromptu get-togethers with PMC friends).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can set up notifications on Discord – and the notifications can be specific to the channels you want to follow. The instructions are a little different for each type of device, but somewhere in the channel settings, or the Discord settings, there will be a place to set up notifications. Be sure you have notifications ON for the Announcements channel to prevent FOMO.</span></p>
<p><strong>Terms of Reference and Constitution</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the time you get this, the Synod of Central, Northeastern Ontario and Bermuda will have approved our new Terms of Reference. And the draft Constitution is ready for legal review.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s Changing?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the new Terms of Reference, we will report directly to the Synod (a division of the Presbyterian Church in Canada), rather than through the Cairn group of camps, as we did for the past few years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our draft constitution provides for a Board of Directors, rather than a camp committee. It also spells out how many Directors we need for a quorum, the rules for calling meetings, and voting at meetings.

<p>Camp will be presented from the evening of Sunday, August 22 through to Saturday, August 28.</p>

<h2 id="mcetoc_1fb398uof1">Theme</h2>
<p>In Paul’s letter to the Corinthians, he sends a very clear message. With both simplicity and brevity, he states that faith, hope, and love are, as he describes them, the choicest of graces. In this famous verse of Scripture, the words, often quoted at weddings, and printed, have hit a chord in the modern world. With this phrase, Paul wraps up this section explaining why godly, self-sacrificing love is required to fully express spiritual gifts. He concludes by mentioning love again with two other virtues often listed with it: faith and hope. Together, these three virtues "abide" or "remain." They are eternal.</p>
<p>Throughout this protracted time of COVID isolation we have all needed to lean on our faith, to find hope when others around us may have none, and to respond with love in a hardening world. As a community, when we are at camp (I mean on the ground, walking the dusty road camp) theses graces are in abundance. The camp experience we often find inexplicable, is a manifestation of, the synergy of the gathering of people in the name of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>During this 2021 virtual camp experience we hope you are able to reflect on the words of Paul. This is an opportunity to share how faith, hope, and love have played a part in our lives, how they have helped us with the challenge of a pandemic, and how we can make these graces the tenets of our future. </p>

<h2 id="mcetoc_1fcj49chk1">Discord</h2>
<p>We’ve mentioned Discord a few times now. If you haven’t used it since last year (or ever!) don’t despair, help is on the way.</p>
<p>If you used Discord last year, it should be there waiting for you this year. You might need to get the app again if you deleted it.</p>
<p>If you’ve never been on Discord before, join with <a href="https://discord.gg/TBapR3w" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this invite link</a>!</p>
<p>It’s free, it’s fun, it’s where all the cool kids are!!!</p>
<p>A lot of people use Discord for all kinds of things besides Music Camp, and they often want to be somewhat anonymous; this is great, but on the PMC server, please use your real name so we know who you are.</p>
<p>Also, a note about Discord notifications: you might want to turn these on before camp starts – either for everything, or for specific channels. In Discord, find Notification Settings on your device, and set it up so it works for you. You might also have to go to Settings on your device to allow notifications from Discord.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1fbssh9os0">Group Gatherings</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">IF Covid rules allow for a gathering in your area, invite some PMC friends over and share the LOVE.</span></p>
<p><strong>Remember</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">: outside is always better, respect the numbers, mask if you have/want to, follow the rules.</span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1fcj2sfhj0">Registration</h2>
<p>With a virtual camp, there is no Registration, and very little cost…BUT</p>
<ul>
<li>This is PMC’s second year with no income.</li>
<li>We have some ongoing expenses – like website hosting fees, Zoom account fees, CCLI license.</li>
<li>We anticipate that there will be increased interest in bursaries when we return to in-person camp.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you can (and only if you can) please consider making a small donation to the Alison Stewart Patterson fund for camp bursaries so we can go into next year in a healthy position. Our suggestion is $10 for an individual or $25 for a family, but you can donate more, or less, it’s up to you.</p>
<p>If you’ve already paid for registration, you can request a refund, or redirect your payment to the ASP bursary fund.</p>
<p>To make a donation: do an e-transfer to pmctreasurer@gmail.com with the security question: what is this payment for and the security answer: aspfund</p>
<p>For any other financial transactions, contact the treasurer at <a href="mailto:pmctreasurer@gmail.com">pmctreasurer@gmail.com</a></p>
<p>Thank you for your support of the PMC ministry!</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1fbsrt0an2">Mailing List</h2>
<p>We know there are lots of people in your life who would LOVE PMC. This is a great year to introduce them to all we have to offer, because there’s no</p>
<ul>
<li>Packing</li>
<li>Driving</li>
<li>Cabins</li>
</ul>
<p>Add your music teacher, choir director, best friend to the mailing list (with their permission, of course), so they can get all the news about Music Camp Trinity and join in. Send a message with the person’s name and email address to <a href="mailto:m.alison.cooper@gmail.com">Alison Cooper</a>.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1fb39fntf6">Land Acknowledgement</h2>
<p>We plan to have a Land Acknowledgement as part of our opening ceremonies – but we know we are all over Ontario (and maybe even further afield) so there are lots of Indigenous peoples to include. If you are interested in presenting a personal Land Acknowledgement as part of the opening ceremonies for Music Camp Trinity, contact <a href="mailto:audetam@gmail.com">Anne Audet</a> to find out how you can participate.</p>
