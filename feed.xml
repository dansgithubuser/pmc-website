                <strong>Presbyterian Music Camp (PMC)</strong> affirms unequivocally that Black Lives Matter. Racism and systemic injustice in any form is antithetical to <strong>PMC</strong>’s purpose and values. <strong>PMC</strong> promises to do our best to, and to continue to learn how to, be a part of the work to eliminate structural racism and white supremacy in all of the spaces of our camp and the rest of our lives.

                <p>The Presbyterian Music Camp community endeavours to be a safe and welcoming place for everyone, from newborns to seniors. Where you are coming from, or where you’re headed to; your past experiences, your dreams for the future; your deepest fears, and your highest hopes, are all a part of who you are and you are welcome in the community that is music camp.</p>
<p>You are welcome with your unique background, heritage and culture. Black Lives Matter. Every Child Matters. Indigenous Peoples and People of Colour are part of our community. We celebrate our diversity which is a reflection of our Creator.</p>
<p>You are welcome if you are single, married, divorced, separated, widowed; whether you live in a family formed by birth, by chance or by choice; whether you have children or not; if you bring children or not; if your children are clinging to your leg all week or you to have tear them away from their new camp family at the end of the week. This is a family camp and families come in all forms.</p>
<p>You are welcome if you are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, Two-Spirit, asexual, pansexual, cisgender, non-binary, or are just learning what most of those terms mean. People of all sexual orientations, gender identities, and gender expressions belong in the PMC community.</p>
<p>You are welcome with all of your physical, emotional and intellectual needs. We consider accessibility in all its forms, and we strive with all our creativity to meet your needs within the rocky forest setting that we love.</p>
<p>You are welcome whether or not you are Presbyterian, if you don’t like “organized religion”, if you bring with you another religious tradition, if you have no faith background, or if you can’t remember the last time you were in a place of worship. We are all on a journey, and we are glad that you have chosen to walk with us for a time.</p>
<p>You are welcome if this is your very first music camp or you have been coming your whole life; whether you make your living in music, or your musical ability is mostly wishful thinking; whether you can carry the whole section, or can’t carry a note in a basket. Music can be enjoyed by everyone.</p>
<p>You are welcome if you prefer shopping bags to sleeping bags, cuddling your teddy bear to a morning dip in the lake, and milk foam in latte to marshmallows in cocoa.</p>
<p>We welcome tree huggers, banjo players, bagpipers, seekers, doubters, bleeding hearts… and YOU!</p>

<p>Camp will be presented from the evening of Sunday, August 22 through to Saturday, August 28.</p>
<p><img class="post__image post__image--center" src="https://presbyterian-music-camp.github.io/website/media/posts/43/pmc-trinity.png" alt="" width="602" height="602"></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1fb398uof1">Theme</h2>
<p>In Paul’s letter to the Corinthians, he sends a very clear message. With both simplicity and brevity, he states that faith, hope, and love are, as he describes them, the choicest of graces. In this famous verse of Scripture, the words, often quoted at weddings, and printed, have hit a chord in the modern world. With this phrase, Paul wraps up this section explaining why godly, self-sacrificing love is required to fully express spiritual gifts. He concludes by mentioning love again with two other virtues often listed with it: faith and hope. Together, these three virtues "abide" or "remain." They are eternal.</p>
<p>Throughout this protracted time of COVID isolation we have all needed to lean on our faith, to find hope when others around us may have none, and to respond with love in a hardening world. As a community, when we are at camp (I mean on the ground, walking the dusty road camp) theses graces are in abundance. The camp experience we often find inexplicable, is a manifestation of, the synergy of the gathering of people in the name of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>During this 2021 virtual camp experience we hope you are able to reflect on the words of Paul. This is an opportunity to share how faith, hope, and love have played a part in our lives, how they have helped us with the challenge of a pandemic, and how we can make these graces the tenets of our future. </p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1fb39a10c3">Schedule</h2>
<p>The schedule is available <a href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src=47lmlug9dndktfcplq96rfndi0@group.calendar.google.com&amp;ctz=America/Toronto" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>!</p>
<p>Anything before about 11:00 will be pre-recorded.</p>

</table>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1fcj49chk1">Discord</h2>
<p>We’ve mentioned Discord a few times now. If you haven’t used it since last year (or ever!) don’t despair, help is on the way.</p>
<p>If you used Discord last year, it should be there waiting for you this year. You might need to get the app again if you deleted it.</p>
<p>If you’ve never been on Discord before, join with <a href="https://discord.gg/TBapR3w" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this invite link</a>!</p>
<p>It’s free, it’s fun, it’s where all the cool kids are!!!</p>
<p>A lot of people use Discord for all kinds of things besides Music Camp, and they often want to be somewhat anonymous; this is great, but on the PMC server, please use your real name so we know who you are.</p>
<p>Also, a note about Discord notifications: you might want to turn these on before camp starts – either for everything, or for specific channels. In Discord, find Notification Settings on your device, and set it up so it works for you. You might also have to go to Settings on your device to allow notifications from Discord.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1fbssh9os0">Group Gatherings</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">IF Covid rules allow for a gathering in your area, invite some PMC friends over and share the LOVE.</span></p>
<p><strong>Remember</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">: outside is always better, respect the numbers, mask if you have/want to, follow the rules.</span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1fcj2sfhj0">Registration</h2>
<p>With a virtual camp, there is no Registration, and very little cost…BUT</p>
<ul>
<li>This is PMC’s second year with no income.</li>
<li>We have some ongoing expenses – like website hosting fees, Zoom account fees, CCLI license.</li>
<li>We anticipate that there will be increased interest in bursaries when we return to in-person camp.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you can (and only if you can) please consider making a small donation to the Alison Stewart Patterson fund for camp bursaries so we can go into next year in a healthy position. Our suggestion is $10 for an individual or $25 for a family, but you can donate more, or less, it’s up to you.</p>
<p>If you’ve already paid for registration, you can request a refund, or redirect your payment to the ASP bursary fund.</p>
<p>To make a donation: do an e-transfer to pmctreasurer@gmail.com with the security question: what is this payment for and the security answer: aspfund</p>
<p>For any other financial transactions, contact the treasurer at <a href="mailto:pmctreasurer@gmail.com">pmctreasurer@gmail.com</a></p>
<p>Thank you for your support of the PMC ministry!</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1fbsrt0an2">Mailing List</h2>
<p>We know there are lots of people in your life who would LOVE PMC. This is a great year to introduce them to all we have to offer, because there’s no</p>
<ul>
<li>Packing</li>
<li>Driving</li>
<li>Cabins</li>
</ul>
<p>Add your music teacher, choir director, best friend to the mailing list (with their permission, of course), so they can get all the news about Music Camp Trinity and join in. Send a message with the person’s name and email address to <a href="mailto:m.alison.cooper@gmail.com">Alison Cooper</a>.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1fb39fntf6">Land Acknowledgement</h2>
<p>We plan to have a Land Acknowledgement as part of our opening ceremonies – but we know we are all over Ontario (and maybe even further afield) so there are lots of Indigenous peoples to include. If you are interested in presenting a personal Land Acknowledgement as part of the opening ceremonies for Music Camp Trinity, contact <a href="mailto:audetam@gmail.com">Anne Audet</a> to find out how you can participate.</p>

                <p>To all the leaders of PMC Trinity for making our second virtual camp sing.</p>
<p>To all the behind-the-scenes people who ran tech, interference, and the ice cream machine.</p>
<p>To all the Board members, for your ongoing commitment to PMC.</p>
<p>AND to all the campers who continue to support PMC through these tough times.</p>
<p>After a well-deserved September off, the PMC Board met on October 23. Some of us were on Zoom, and some were together again. It felt great (and a bit odd) to see some folks live again.</p>
<p>We spent some time at our first Board meeting on feedback. We plan to develop some of the great ideas for camp 2022, but we have all agreed:</p>
<h4 id="mcetoc_1fj251ofa1" class="align-center">NO 3PEAT!</h4>
<p> </p>
<p>PMC 2022 is booked at Tamarack from August 21-28. We are pulling out all the stops to make this an IN-PERSON, F2F, real live camp, because…</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1fj252quk2" class="align-center">2022 is the</h3>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1fj253dpu3" class="align-center">50TH ANNIVERSARY</h2>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1fj253jfa4" class="align-center">of PMC</h3>
<p>PMC started in 1972, back when the summer and winter Olympics were in the same year. The same year that Watergate began.</p>
<p>There is an Anniversary Sub-committee brainstorming ideas for this celebration. Contact MJ if you’d like to help, with the subject line PMC - 50 years of harmony (<a href="mailto:m.j.perry@mac.com">m.j.perry@mac.com</a>)</p>

<h3 id="mcetoc_1f6s5h38d1"><strong>The</strong> bad<strong> news</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is so hard to send this message…</span></p>
<p>Once again, we are in the position of having to cancel an in-person camp for 2021. We make this heart-rending decision for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our program does not lend itself to cohorting to reduce transmission. Mask wearing and physical distancing would make our program even more difficult.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We would have to give up too much of what makes camp special to us – like singing.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of our community members may not be able to attend at all, because</span>

<h3 id="mcetoc_1f3ip3ccu6">Camp 2021</h3>
<p>There’s been another meeting of OCA camps, but still no official answer on in-person camps this summer, and we don’t know when that answer might be coming.</p>
<p>The PMC Covid Implications Working group has begun discussing our plans for the summer of 2021 in a Covid environment. While the news this week was not good (in fact, terrible), we are still preparing for an in-person camp in August. BUT, we are also thinking about what a virtual camp might look like this year, and how we can build on the lessons learned in August 2020.</p>
<p>If you have ideas for a virtual camp this year, we’d love to hear from you!!</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1f3ip60178">Inclusion at PMC</h3>
<p>Like many other camps, we have started a conversation about inclusion and how we can make it more obvious to potential campers that we are an inclusive community – in all areas where inclusion matters. Some of the things we are planning are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A more explicit welcoming statement on our website and in other materials</li>
<li>A covenant for campers to outline what we expect at camp</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have ideas how the PMC community can be more inclusive in ANY area, please get in touch with us. Lois Rooney-Giurin is steering this project (<a href="mailto:loisrg@outlook.com">loisrg@outlook.com</a>).</p>

There are lots of ways to participate. And check your junk mail folder, just in case.</p>

<h3 id="mcetoc_1f1e6b4aa0">Camp 2021</h3>
<p>There’s been lots of talk in the news about opening camps this summer, but still no official answer. The OCA town hall on March 1 reinforced that there is no decision yet, but there IS lots of guidance on what we might have to do.</p>
<p>We spent time at our meeting on March 20 talking about what makes camp so special – this will help us to decide where we draw the line on changing our program to meet the guidelines (whatever the guidelines end up being).</p>
<p>The PMC Board also struck a working group to look at our programs and the guidelines in preparation for some further discussion over the next 2 months.</p>

We are starting a long-term project to make these more accessible than a box in someone’s basement.</p>
<p>If you have stuff to share, or if you’d like to help, let us know!!</p>
