            <![CDATA[
                <p>The PMC board was notified near the end of October 2022 that Camp Tamarack was considering renting their facility to a different group during the week we traditionally rent. They confirmed this decision on the 19th of November.</p>
<p>On hearing the initial news, the PMC board struck a subcommittee to start a new site search. In the weeks between learning Camp Tamarack’s intentions and their ultimate decision, the subcommittee reviewed the Ontario Camp Association list of camps that rent their facility and screened out the ones that clearly wouldn’t work. From that list of almost 100 camps, the subcommittee identified 22 camps that looked like they might be able to accommodate our program and that didn’t have an obvious conflict with dates. After getting the confirmation that Camp Tamarack would not be available to us, the subcommittee members split up the list and held phone interviews with each camp. From that list of 22, only two camps were viable candidates.</p>
<p><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">After visiting both sites in early December 2022, and carefully considering their abilities to meet our needs and support our program, the subcommittee put forward a recommendation to pursue contracting with Camp Kintail for 2023. On Saturday December 17, 2022, the PMC Board met and voted to accept that recommendation.</span></p>
<p>Camp Kintail is a very <span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">active camp and conference facility that operates 10 months of the year, focusing on children’s and family camps in the summer and hosting groups with diverse interests throughout the year. The camp executive director, Johnathon Lee, is very familiar with PMC through his Presbyterian Church connections and through personal connections to current and former campers. The Camp Kintail organization is delighted to be hosting PMC and building a long-term relationship. The site is beautiful, the buildings are updated and well-kept. The chef at Camp Kintail has an excellent reputation. There are excellent accommodations, workshop facilities and outdoor gathering places that will support our camp’s program and community needs. Great care has been taken to make every area of the site and buildings accessible. It’s also important to acknowledge that Camp Kintail’s connection to the Presbyterian Church, and the obvious support that it receives from its community and Synod will be a strong foundation for a long-term relationship.</span></p>
<p>Ian MacCready has prepared a really good <a href="https://ln5.sync.com/dl/cd8526b40/scw5zwd8-fa9ghd8g-qx6xk4xz-xxijxv39">pictorial tour of Camp Kintail</a> which you can see by clicking the link. Ian has organized the photos in folders that identify the pictures with the landmarks on the site map that’s in the root directory. Please note that the map is more of an artist’s rendition, but it certainly gives you a good sense of the features of the site.</p>
<p>The PMC board is confident that the choice of Kintail is the right one and is determined to help mitigate the inconvenience for those that have to travel a longer distance to get to camp. </p>

<p class="p4">PMC 2022<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">Wasn’t it great to be back in person for camp??!! In some ways it felt like just a few weeks since we had been together. There was lots of time to hang out with family and friends, and renew relationships. Your feedback (positive and not so positive) is appreciated. We have reviewed it and will consider it more deeply as we prepare for PMC 2023.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">The 50<span class="s2">th </span>Anniversary Celebrations are over, but the Circle of Love song is a video on YouTube; click here for your dose of nostalgia.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">CHARITABLE STATUS<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">It’s official – we have our charitable status back! Thanks to the efforts of Doug Kendall and others, we filled in forms, talked to CRA, had one emergency board meeting at camp, and it’s finally done.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">This means you will get a charitable donation receipt for 2022 – BUT the receipt won’t include your auction donations, because you got (or will get) something for those.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">For those who held off making a donation until you could get a receipt, now is your chance; if you make a donation by the end of the year you will get a tax credit for 2022. (We don’t desperately need your donation, and it’s entirely up to you.) Contact the Treasurer for more info.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

                <p>PMC 2022 is booked at Tamarack from August 21-28. We are pulling out all the stops to make this an in-person, face-to-face, real live camp, because 2022 is the <a href="https://presbyterian-music-camp.github.io/website/50-years-of-harmony.html">50th anniversary</a> of PMC!<br><br>The theme of PMC 2022 theme is:</p>
<p class="align-center"><em>The Long and Dusty Road: Life as a Pilgrimage</em></p>
<p>We would appreciate if you <a href="https://presbyterian-music-camp.github.io/website/register.html">register</a> sooner rather than later to give us an idea of numbers. Read on for everything we know so far that might help you decide if you can come this year or not. If you want to come but can’t quite commit, please email the registrar (Cathy Whiteside, <a href="mailto:pmcregistrar@gmail.com">pmcregistrar@gmail.com</a>) so we know about you.</p>
<p>Vaccination for Covid-19 will be required for those aged 6 and up to attend PMC in 2022, except for those with medical exemptions. <span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">We have made this decision so that we can provide a camp and program you are used to, and to protect our community, particularly those who cannot be vaccinated yet.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">A vaccine is now available for children age 5 and under. A first dose is strongly encouraged, but is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> required (as it may not be possible for parents to schedule this before camp).</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Visitors to PMC</strong></span></p>
<p>As of June 23, we WILL be allowing visits to PMC. There are a few restrictions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Visitors must be fully vaccinated, following the requirements for all campers;</li>
<li>Avoid activities that might expose you to Covid in the week leading up to the visit;</li>
<li>Take a rapid test 5 days before the visit and again the day of the visit;</li>
<li>Plan to stay on site for the duration of your visit. (Leaving is discouraged, as it is for all campers.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Contact the registrar (Cathy Whiteside, <a href="mailto:pmcregistrar@gmail.com">pmcregistrar@gmail.com</a>), to make arrangements for your visit, especially if you will need accommodation, as space is limited.</p>
<p>If possible, arrange to come on Saturday, so you can hear the concert, eat a delicious lunch, enjoy the birthday party, and spend your savings on the auction!</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">This Year's Schedule</span></p>
<p>The schedule is almost done; you can find the almost final version <a href="https://presbyterian-music-camp.github.io/website/pmc week schedule 2022_combined_Aug10.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. Further changes will be announced AT CAMP.</p>

                <h1><strong>PMC 2022 </strong></h1>
<p>2 MONTHS TILL CAMP!!</p>
<p>Dates (in case you don’t know yet): <strong>August 21-28</strong></p>
<p><strong>Vaccination</strong><strong> </strong>for Covid-19 <u>will be required</u> to attend PMC in 2022 (with medical exemptions, of course). For children under 5: vaccination for this group is not yet approved in Canada. If vaccination becomes available for this group before camp, we’ll figure out how it applies.</p>
<p>We are thrilled to see large numbers of people registering for PMC; lots of returning campers and a number of new campers too! At this point, cabin space is very, very limited. If you requested a solo cabin for just yourself, but might be willing to share with one or two others, would you please email Cathy Whiteside at <a href="mailto:pmcregistrar@gmail.com">pmcregistrar@gmail.com</a> and let her know? You can even choose your cabin mate(s). Thanks in advance!</p>
<h2>Visitors</h2>
<p>Visitors WILL be permitted at camp (Hurray!) provided they:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are fully vaccinated</li>
<li>Can minimize possible exposure to Covid in the week before the visit</li>
<li>Have a negative rapid test 5 days before the visit and again the day of the visit</li>
<li>Plan to remain on site for the duration of the visit</li>
</ul>
<p>Contact Cathy Whiteside (<a href="mailto:pmcregistrar@gmail.com">pmcregistrar@gmail.com</a>) ahead of time to confirm arrangements for your visit.</p>
<p>Try to plan your visit for Saturday if possible – for the Concert, 50<sup>th</sup> Anniversary Birthday Party, and the Auction.</p>
<h2>New Camper Meet &amp; Greet</h2>
<p>If you are a new camper, or know someone who is new, make sure they know about the New Camper Meet &amp; Greet, on the first day of camp, probably right before dinner.</p>
<h2>Tuckets</h2>
<p>Inflation has hit PMC – tuckets will be $0.50 each this year. Prices of tuck items are being adjusted to reflect the new tucket price.</p>
<h1>Volunteers Needed</h1>
<p>Please send a message to <a href="mailto:presbyterianmusiccamp@gmail.com">presbyterianmusiccamp@gmail.com</a> if you can help with 1 or more of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>At Camp: Evening worship (one day), Teen counsellors, Bible Study</li>
<li>Transportation of things from Toronto to camp (merchandise, hand drums)</li>
<li>Board members for the 2022-2023 Board</li>
</ul>
<h1><strong>50 YEARS OF HARMONY</strong></h1>
<h2>Circle of Love – Our 50<sup>th</sup> Anniversary Song</h2>
<p>If you missed the World Premiere at General Assembly, check out the <a href="Here's%20the%20link:%20https:/www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3eiQ6BnKAg">YouTube link</a> to see the video and hear the song. And don’t worry – you’ll have lots more chances to hear it at camp!</p>
<h2>Kitchen Parties</h2>
<p>Here are the dates again, in case you missed them.</p>
<p>KW/Guelph/Cambridge area:             July 9</p>
<p>Toronto area:                                      July 16</p>
<p>Ottawa Valley:                                    July 23 (with overnight!)</p>
<p>See the PMC Discord site, or the last email, for details.</p>
<h2>Auction</h2>
<p>You haven’t missed it!</p>
<p>The auction will be on Saturday afternoon at camp, with our auctioneer Carrie Pilgrim.</p>
<p>We can still accommodate auction items. They can be things you buy, things you make, or services you provide.</p>
<p>To donate an item or service to be auctioned, please contact MJ at <a href="mailto:presbyterianmusiccamp@gmail.com">presbyterianmusiccamp@gmail.com</a>.</p>
<p>For donated services: (e.g., babysitting, dinner for 4, planting a garden) specify your radius of travel.</p>
<h2>Home Movies</h2>
<p>The 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary committee is still looking for your home movies to show at camp. Digital is preferred, but we aren’t picky. Contact MJ at <a href="mailto:presbyterianmusiccamp@gmail.com">presbyterianmusiccamp@gmail.com</a>.</p>

<p>IT’S OFFICIAL – PMC 2022 will be IN PERSON (see the fine print below)</p>

Children under 5 will not be required to be vaccinated (since they can’t be yet). If vaccination becomes available for this group before camp, we’ll figure out how it applies.</p>
<p>Discussions at the June meeting will focus on our Covid rules and restrictions. We’ll have more information about those in the next summary.<strong> </strong></p>

And if your children have grown up too fast and want to get their own emails, let us know – we can add them too. Send an email to Alison Cooper.</p>

<p>Theme: <strong>The Long and Dusty Road: Life as a Pilgrimage.</strong></p>
<p>Dates: <strong>August 21-28</strong></p>

<p><strong>Refund policy</strong> is on the <a href="https://presbyterian-music-camp.github.io/website/register.html">registration page</a>; we really hope that we won’t have to cancel camp because of Covid, but the refund policy covers that in case we do.</p>
<p>Right now, we don’t know if we will be able to have <strong>visitors</strong> to camp. Please be aware that you (or your friends) may not be able to come for the weekend this year, depending on the Covid situation. Check the website closer to camp for information about this.</p>
<p><strong>Vaccination</strong> for Covid-19 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">will be required</span> to attend PMC in 2022 (with medical exemptions, of course). We have made this decision so that we can provide a camp and program you are used to, and to protect our community, particularly those who cannot be vaccinated yet. More details about this later.</p>
<p>We’re starting to work on the <strong>program and schedule</strong> for 2022. If you’d like to lead a workshop, contact Jesse Fegelman at <a href="mailto:presbyterianmusiccamp@gmail.com">presbyterianmusiccamp@gmail.com</a> before he calls you!</p>
<h2>50 YEARS OF HARMONY</h2>
<p>The 50th Anniversary Committee has been hard at work planning special events to celebrate this milestone on our journey. Some events will happen at camp, but a few things are planned before camp:</p>
<h3>Kitchen Parties</h3>
<p>There are 3 parties in the planning stages so far – Ottawa Valley area, Kingston, and Toronto. Dates will be confirmed in early March.</p>
<h3>Auction</h3>
<p>We’re planning an auction as a FUNdraiser. Details and date (likely June) to be confirmed.</p>
<p>If you want to donate an item or service to be auctioned, please contact MJ at <a href="mailto:presbyterianmusiccamp@gmail.com">presbyterianmusiccamp@gmail.com</a> with the details. The plan is to deliver the item at camp in August, to avoid shipping charges.</p>
