The week is spent living as a community and focusing on growing in faith, as musicians, and as a family. Although the camp is affiliated with the Presbyterian Church in Canada, the camp is open to everyone, regardless of religious beliefs (including none at all). In addition to faith-based activities, there are many ways to participate that do not require actively taking part in worship. Many repeat campers attend for purely musical reasons and because they enjoy the feel of the camp.</p><p dir="ltr">The week begins with old friends and new greeting each other. The “getting to know you” activities are followed by a meditative opening ceremony. Each weekday there are five workshop periods covering a broad variety of learning opportunities to choose from. The workshop leaders are also your fellow campers! The daily schedule includes morning and evening devotions, breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks. After dinner each evening a unique evening program is held.</p><p dir="ltr">Campers have a choice of accommodation in a cabin with family or friends, or on their own. There is a teen cabin for boys and one for girls (aged 13 to 18), and a young adult cabin for young men and one for young women (aged 19 to 30s), as well as many smaller family, couples, and single cabins throughout the site. One of the wonderful things about the Presbyterian Music Camp programming is that the activities are intergenerational, with the exception of some special programming geared toward children and teens. Workshops are open to anyone who is interested. This provides a diverse body of knowledge and skills over decades of ages and different walks of life which enriches the experience.</p><p dir="ltr">The camp is run fully by volunteers. The committee is made up of veteran campers who meet throughout the year to plan various aspects of camp. The committee also handles finances, registration, and makes decisions about how the camp is run, including staffing. The camp leaders for the week are known as the deans, and they are campers who have attended for at least several years (decades in most cases!). The deans choose a central theme around which worship and devotions are based. Workshop leaders, who are also campers, select music pieces for worship, devotions, and performances based, if possible, on the theme. There is a camp first-aider who is present to assist as needed, for scrapes, bruises and other minor concerns. Each camper has a role in the camp experience; campers volunteer and are responsible for cleaning common areas and keeping the campus clean. Camp Tamarack comes with a paid kitchen staff who provide all meals and snacks, a cleaning crew that clean bathrooms and showers, and paid lifeguards to keep waterfront activities supervised and safe.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Camp Tamarack</h2><p dir="ltr">Camp Tamarack is located just north of Bracebridge in the heart of the Muskokas. The site boasts a private lake with a beach and docks, trained lifeguards, canoes and kayaks for use by campers, tennis and basketball courts, a soccer field, campfire pits, all in a forest setting. Buildings on site include a dining hall, large and small performance spaces, new bathroom facilities and private stalled showers, cabins with bunk beds hosting up to 10 music campers at a time, and some smaller cabins for couples and singles. Some cabins are equipped with private bathrooms, and some of the cabins are newly renovated.</p><p dir="ltr">You can learn more about Camp Tamarack on their <a href="https://camptamarack.info">website</a>.</p><h2 dir="ltr">History</h2><p dir="ltr">In 1972 the first Music Camp was hosted as a one time event to introduce the new Presbyterian Book of Praise. The idea of the camp was for church organists to become familiar with the music. Since the event was planned for summer, the invitation was opened up to families as well. Presbyterian Music Camp met that year at a camp on Golden Lake in the Ottawa Valley and it was so popular that it was held again the following year, and subsequent years to follow. By 1990, the camp had outgrown the Golden Lake site and moved to the current site at Camp Tamarack near Bracebridge, where it is hosted in the last full week of August each summer. The Organising Committee and staff are made up of dedicated volunteers.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Past Years</h2><p>Certain aspects of camp, especially the selection of workshops and evening programs, are planned throughout the year.
