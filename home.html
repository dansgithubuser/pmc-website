We live as a community and spend the week focusing on growing in faith, as musicians, and as a family. The camp is open to people of all ages and walks of life. All meals are eaten together in a community, and dietary restrictions are accommodated. Although the camp is affiliated with the Presbyterian Church, the camp is open to all, regardless of religious affiliation, regardless if you have any religious belief at all. There are many secular and non-secular activities to partake in, and those who attend for purely musical reasons enjoy the community feel of the camp.</p><p dir="ltr">The week begins with welcoming old friends and new which is followed by a meditative opening ceremony. Each weekday has 5 workshop periods which enable you to sign up for a broad variety of lessons. The workshop leaders are your fellow campers! Some examples of workshop titles are listed below. Each day also includes morning and evening devotions, breakfast,  lunch, dinner and snacks. After dinner each evening a unique evening program is held. Look for examples of evening activities below.</p><p dir="ltr">People attending the camp can choose to live in a cabin either with family, friends or on their own. There is a teen cabin (aged 13 to 18), and a young adult cabin (aged 19 to 30s), and many smaller family and single cabins throughout the camp. One of the wonderful parts of the Presbyterian Music Camp community is the intergenerational activities, with the exception of child/teen workshops, anyone is welcome to join workshops. This means there is a diverse spread of knowledge and skills over decades of age differences and walks of life.</p><p dir="ltr">The camp is run fully by volunteers, the organising committee is made up of campers who meet throughout the year to plan various aspects of camp, handle finances, run registration, and make decisions about how the camp is run. The figure heads the week of camp are known as the Deans and are campers who have attended for several years (decades in most cases!), the deans choose a central theme which worship and devotions are based around. Often workshop leaders will pick music often to the theme. The workshop leaders are also fellow campers, these leaders plan in the weeks and months before camp to select music pieces, or workshop activities to run while at camp! There is a camp first-aider who is also attending the camp. While at camp, campers volunteer and are responsible for cleaning common areas and keeping the campus clean. Camp Tamarack comes with a paid kitchen staff who provide all meals and snacks, as well as a cleaning crew who clean bathrooms and showers, and paid lifeguards.</p><p dir="ltr">Are you…</p><h2 dir="ltr">Looking to develop as a musician?</h2><p dir="ltr">We have all levels of workshops which appeal to everyone from beginner to advanced.  Workshops include Camp Choir, Advanced Choir, Teen Choir, Singing for non-singers, Guitar, Ukulele, Banjo, Bagpipes, Show Choir, Handbell choir, Concert Band, Jazz Band, Garage Band, Celtic Group, Strings Ensemble, Drum Circle, Swing Dancing, Salsa Dancing, Sound and Drama Improvisation.

Although the camp is a Presbyterian camp, many Christians and non-Christians attend the camp. Workshops include Bible Study, and Contemporary Christian Music. Other activities include, Morning Worship, Evening Devotions. Check out this blog post about living in a spiritual community.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Wanting to spend time together as a young family?</h2><p dir="ltr">Each year the camp welcomes people of all ages to attend, so young families will feel at home in at Presbyterian Music Camp. Workshops for children include Cherubs (1.5 to 5 year olds - while parents can attend workshops of their own), Parent and Tot, Children's Choir, Children's games, Crafts for Kids, and Sport of the Day. As well the camp is situated on a private lake where you can have some beach time with our fully qualified lifeguards.

The site boasts a private lake with a beach and docks, trained lifeguards, canoes and kayaks for use by campers, tennis and basketball courts, soccer field, campfire pits and forests. Buildings on site include a dining hall, large and small performance spaces, new bathroom facilities and private stalled showers, cabins with bunk beds hosting up to 10 music campers at a time. Some cabins are equipped with private bathrooms, and some of the cabins are newly renovated.</p><h2 dir="ltr">A History of Presbyterian Music Camp</h2><p dir="ltr">Back in 1972 the first Music Camp was hosted as a one time event to introduce the new Presbyterian Book of Praise. The idea of the camp was for church organists to become familiar with the new music. Since it was decided to be held in summer the invite was opened to their families as well. Presbyterian Music Camp met that year at a camp on Golden Lake in the Ottawa Valley and it went so well that it was encouraged to be organized again for the following year, and subsequent to follow! This formed a new Christian community brought together by music! By 1990 the camp outgrew its previous site and moved to the current site at Camp Tamarack near Bracebridge, where it is hosted in the last full week of August each summer. The organising committee and staff is made up of dedicated volunteers. Check us out on Facebook and Instagram!</p></div></div></body></html>
