With both simplicity and brevity, he states that faith, hope, and love are, as he describes them, the choicest of graces. In this famous verse of Scripture, the words, often quoted at weddings, and printed, have hit a chord in the modern world. With this phrase, Paul wraps up this section explaining why godly, self-sacrificing love is required to fully express spiritual gifts. He concludes by mentioning love again with two other virtues often listed with it: faith and hope. Together, these three virtues "abide" or "remain." They are eternal.</p><p>Throughout this protracted time of COVID isolation we have all needed to lean on our faith, to find hope when others around us may have none, and to respond with love in a hardening world. As a community, when we are at camp (I mean on the ground, walking the dusty road camp) theses graces are in abundance. The camp experience we often find inexplicable, is a manifestation of, the synergy of the gathering of people in the name of Jesus Christ.</p><p>During this 2021 virtual camp experience we hope you are able to reflect on the words of Paul. This is an opportunity to share how faith, hope, and love have played a part in our lives, how they have helped us with the challenge of a pandemic, and how we can make these graces the tenets of our future.</p><h2>Artistic Directors</h2><p>You have 3 Artistic Directors for Music Camp Trinity: Cynthia McMinn, Anne Audet, and Alison Cooper.
