The PMC Board plus members of the Site Search Subcommittee presented information on both sites at the December 17 Board meeting, and addressed questions from board members.</p><p>The decision came down to a few key issues:</p><ul><li>Camp Gesher:<ul><li>Facilities could meet our needs; more centrally located</li><li>More rustic; more rugged terrain, affecting accessibility</li></ul></li><li>Camp Kintail:<ul><li>Fantastic facilities; affiliated with the Presbyterian Church</li><li>Longer travel distance for campers east of the GTA.</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>After much discussion, and on the recommendation of the Site Search Subcommittee, the Board voted to contract with Camp Kintail for the summer of 2023.</strong></p><p>The Board recognizes that this decision will affect some campers more than others, and is now working on plans to make this transition as easy as possible, particularly for those people who will have a longer drive. Watch for more information about these plans as they are firmed up.</p><p>The Board’s next steps are:</p><ul><li>Develop another video about the Site Search process and decision</li><li>Get a contract in place with Camp Kintail for 2023</li><li>Determine prices for 2023 so we can move forward with registration</li><li>Update the website, Camper Guide, etc., etc.</li><li>Make decisions about programs, locations, events</li><li>Do the 101 others things that need to be done to support the transition to a new site</li></ul><p>For a preview of Camp Kintail, check out their <a href="https://www.campkintail.ca/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a>.</p><h3>Site Search Info from November (posted November 26)</h3><p class="align-center"><a href="https://youtu.be/bogvr3oTM1s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Watch a video announcement</a></p><p>We have some news to share about PMC at Camp Tamarack. Tamarack has told us that they cannot rent to us in 2023. The PMC Board had word that we were at risk about 5 weeks ago, and Tamarack confirmed that on November 19.</p><p>Since getting the news, we have started work on an intensive site search, and the site search subcommittee is optimistic that we will have something in place for 2023. Be assured that the Board has every intention of us gathering together as a community for camp in our usual week in August 2023.</p><p>We have changed sites before, and survived (and flourished). But for many of you, the Tamarack site is all you know, and this will be a big change. We are focusing on the potential positives in all this. But with the time constraints, we may have to make compromises in some areas.</p><p>The site search committee membership is: Taras Broadhead, Marilyn Broadhead, Lindsay Weidelich, Cathy Whiteside, Anne Audet, Scott Cooper, and Ian MacCready.</p><p>The committee took a long list of rental camps and narrowed this down (by size, location, and facilities), to 22 camps to interview by phone. From these phone interviews, they have identified 2 fantastic sites to visit in the next two weeks.</p><p>We will have an update for you in early 2023. The PMC Board is having a rare December meeting because of the urgency of this task.</p><p>Remember always that the site is just a backdrop for the people and ideas that make PMC special. PMC is different now from what it was at Golden Lake, and it will change again as we adapt to a new site.</p><p>If you want to talk about the change and how it affects you or your family, please reach out to <a href="mailto:taras.broadhead@gmail.com">Taras Broadhead</a>, <a href="mailto:marilyn.broadhead@gmail.com">Marilyn Broadhead</a>, <a href="mailto:lindsay.weidelich@gmail.com">Lindsay Weidelich</a>, <a href="mailto:imaccready@maestropro.ca">Ian MacCready</a>, or the <a href="mailto:presbyterianmusiccamp@gmail.com">PMC email</a>. </p></div></div></body></html>
