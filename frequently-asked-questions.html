The Board embarked on an accelerated site search and Camp Kintail was the hands-down winner. We’re excited to be moving to our first Presbyterian home!</p><p><strong>Camp Kintail is a really long drive for me!<br></strong>We sympathize! That was the only difficult part of our decision to move there. If you’ve registered for camp and are concerned about this, please let us know and we’ll see if we can help.</p><p><strong>Why is camp shorter this year?</strong><br>Camp Kintail is open for 10 months of the year and hosts lots of events. Our 2023 camp is scheduled for Sunday-Friday to accommodate wedding celebrations that were already booked for both Saturdays.</p><p><strong>Why is there a limit of 150 people?<br></strong>We are limiting registration to 150 people for a couple of reasons:</p><ul><li>150 people at PMC means a lot of households represented. This makes planning sleeping accommodations very challenging. It’s becoming clear that, with our current demographics, 150 is about the limit.</li><li>We have found that with a camp community of more than about 150 people it is difficult to get to know everyone.</li></ul><p><strong>What are the Covid protocols for PMC 2023?<br></strong>The Covid protocols are being updated and will be included in the Camper Handbook. Please follow the vaccination protocol that is recommended for you and plan on testing before arriving at camp.</p><p><strong>How do I make a donation to PMC?<br></strong>You can donate when you register, or contact the Treasurer, <a href="#INTERNAL_LINK#/post/null">pmctreasurer@gmail.com</a>. </p><h3>Food</h3><p><strong>Are all of my meals and snacks included?<br></strong>For the most part, yes! Your camper fees include all meals at camp. The only exception is afternoon tuck, when a variety of snacks and drinks are available for purchase. All proceeds from tuck go to the Alison Stewart-Patterson fund.</p><p><strong>Can I bring my own snacks?<br></strong>Yes. Camp Kintail is nut-free, so we respectfully ask that guests not bring food containing nuts/nut products into the site. Please bring an animal-proof container if you’re planning on keeping snacks in your living area.</p><p><strong>Is the food actually good?<br></strong>YES! Camp Kintail’s chef has a great reputation, and meals generally include a few options, so even the pickiest eaters should be satisfied! In addition, Kintail has an on-site garden that supplies some of their produce, and the dining hall has coffee, tea, and juice available at all times. </p><p><strong>I have allergies/dietary restrictions; can these be accommodated?<br></strong>Yes. Note that Camp Kintail is a nut-free facility. The kitchen staff are used to dealing with different allergies and dietary needs throughout their summer camps and other rental groups, so they should be able to keep you well fed through the week. If you have dietary needs please note them on your registration form, or contact the Registrar (<a href="#INTERNAL_LINK#/post/null">pmcregistrar@gmail.com</a>) to discuss your needs further. If you have very severe food allergies or multiple dietary restrictions and wish to bring some of your own food, a fridge is available in the dining hall for storage; just make sure everything is very clearly labeled with your name. The PMC Board has a Camp Liaison who will assist with any issues or concerns that arise at camp.</p><h3>Accommodations</h3><p><strong>What are the Camp Kintail accommodations like?<br></strong>There are several different styles of accommodation at Camp Kintail, all of which are clean,  well-maintained and wheelchair accessible. We will do our best to assign one family to a dwelling; however, due to limited space it may be necessary for some families to share. We try to be mindful of assigning shared spaces to families who either know each other well or have asked to share. Traditional cabins and yurts at Kintail do not have washrooms or showers, but these facilities are available close by the cabin area, in MacDonald Lodge, and in The Nest.</p><ul><li><strong>Cabins:</strong> Many PMC campers will stay in dormitory-style cabins that would usually sleep about 10-12 campers on bunk beds during Kintail’s regular summer program. We will be using some smaller cabins as well. The larger cabins each have 2 private change rooms. All of the cabins have electricity.</li><li><strong>Yurts:</strong> Kintail has four yurts, which have the same features as the larger cabins (including electricity and change rooms), just in a different structure.</li><li><strong>MacDonald Lodge:</strong> MacDonald Lodge sleeping accommodations are located in the back half of the dining hall building. They include several private rooms that can sleep 3-5 guests in bunk beds (some single/single style, others with a queen bed on bottom and single on top), with shared washroom and shower facilities in the hallway of the sleeping area. Additional washrooms and showers are available in the main part of MacDonald Lodge for campers staying elsewhere on site.  A small laundry facility is also available in MacDonald Lodge for guests to use if needed. </li><li><strong>The Nest:</strong> The Nest has private and group rooms that can sleep 3-10 guests in bunk beds (single/single and queen/single, as in MacDonald Lodge). Each of these guest rooms includes a private full washroom. The main floor of The Nest also includes washrooms and private showers (including one fully accessible washroom and shower) for use by campers staying elsewhere on site. There is a large kitchen as well.</li></ul><p><strong>Can I bring my own trailer?<br></strong>Camp Kintail has informal parking spots for RVs and trailers outside MacDonald Lodge with household 110V electrical hookups available; you will need to bring your own extension cords. Potable water is available from an outdoor tap at the back of the Lodge. If you plan to bring your trailer please note that there is no sewer, but a dump site is located about 20-30 minutes away from the camp.</p><p><strong>Do I have to stay with my family?<br></strong>If you’re under the age of 13 (and won’t turn 13 before the end of the calendar year), then yes, you will need to stay with the parent or guardian who is with you at camp. For campers aged 13 and up we have male and female cabins available for singles of various ages and stages.</p><h3>Facilities</h3><p><strong>Is the site accessible?<br></strong>YES! Great care has been taken in recent years to ensure that all of Camp Kintail’s buildings, cabins, and activities are fully wheelchair accessible.</p><p><strong>What about washrooms and showers?<br></strong>There are washrooms located on Cabin Hill, in MacDonald Lodge and in The Nest. From any cabin, the longest walk to a bathroom is 1 minute. Both MacDonald Lodge and The Nest also have showers.</p><p><strong>Are there laundry facilities on site?<br></strong>Yes. There are 4 washing machines and 4 dryers in MacDonald Lodge.</p><p><strong>Can I drink the water?<br></strong>Yes. Camp Kintail has a state of the art water treatment system that includes chlorination. The water is tested daily to ensure that it meets all Ontario water legislation. The water testing is monitored by an outside company called Veolia, who are responsible for other systems along Lake Huron and the Town of Goderich.</p><p><strong>What other amenities are available at Camp Kintail?<br></strong>In addition to the sleeping cabins and dining hall, Camp Kintail has multiple program buildings that PMC uses for our workshops and morning and evening programs. The camp site also has a large beachfront on Lake Huron, sports fields, a beautiful outdoor Chapel, and plenty of natural space to enjoy. </p><p><strong>Is there cell service?<br></strong>Yes. Cell service is excellent at Camp Kintail.</p><h3>PMC Program</h3><p><strong>What will I be doing all day?<br></strong>Our PMC program includes a wonderful variety of morning and evening programs for the whole camp community, five workshop periods during the day to meet smaller groups of people and learn new things, and free time to relax and socialize. Please see our <a href="https://presbyterian-music-camp.github.io/website/home.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">About</a> page for more information.</p><p><strong>Do I have to take a workshop in every period?<br></strong>No. Some campers like to sign up for 5 workshops and have a busy day, other campers take just a few of their favourite workshops, and some campers come just to enjoy being in the natural setting and spending time with friends and family.</p><p><strong>Can I take different workshops on different days?<br></strong>It depends. Some workshops like crafts are designed as drop-ins or scheduled for just a couple of days. Many of the workshops, particularly those that involve learning music as a group, are designed to build experience each day. For everyone’s enjoyment of these workshops, it’s important to have the same group working consistently together all week. You can talk to your workshop leader if you have questions about this. Of course, if you sign up for a workshop and find that it isn’t the right fit after one or two days don’t force yourself to stay; this just means you’ll end up with a free period, which isn’t always the worst thing!</p><p><strong>What about programming for kids?<br></strong>There are lots of activities for our younger campers. Each morning, children’s choir and children’s games are scheduled (usually for ages 6 – 12) so parents have a chance to participate in their own workshops. In the afternoon, there are a number of beginner-level workshops, crafts, and swimming to keep everyone busy. For our youngest campers (up to age 5) a child-minding program is available through the morning with music, games, and other activities. Some afternoon children’s or beginner-level workshops may have an age requirement or request for an adult companion - please check with the workshop leaders at the start of camp.</p><p><strong>Do I have to participate in all of the camp-wide activities?<br></strong>We encourage all campers to participate in order to get the full PMC experience and integrate into our community, but attendance at activities like devotions and evening program is not mandatory. If you chose not to attend a camp-wide scheduled activity we do ask that you not create a disruption for those who are taking part.</p><p><strong>Is PMC for me? Do I belong? Will I have a good time?<br></strong>We try our best to make sure everyone feels welcome and has fun at PMC. When we fall short, we do our best to fix it. The Camp Deans and members of our Board are always available to help anyone in the community. Please read our <a href="https://presbyterian-music-camp.github.io/website/welcome-statement.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Welcome Statement</a> for more PMC thoughts on the following questions:</p><ul><li><strong>I’m not Presbyterian; is that okay?</strong> Absolutely. PMC’s community is diverse in this way (and many others).</li><li><strong>Someone in my family has special needs; can they still come to camp?</strong> If a camper has needs that require specialized assistance (such as a full-time caregiver) they will need to bring someone to camp with them to help, and that person will need to register and pay for PMC. Bursaries may be available to help cover the cost of a care-giver for a camper with special needs. Contact our registrar for more information.</li><li><strong>Is PMC 2SLGBTQIA+ friendly?</strong> Both PMC and Camp Kintail are fully inclusive. Love is love (and gender-neutral washrooms and showers are available).</li><li><strong>I don’t know if my musical skills are good enough; should I come to camp?</strong> While most of our workshops are music-focused we do have several options every day that are non-musical as well, so don’t let this stop you from coming! For our musical workshops we offer a variety of skill levels, so everyone from beginners to advanced musicians will have somewhere that they fit in.</li><li><strong>I found PMC online and want to come, but I won’t know anyone!</strong> Not to toot our own horns, but we are very welcoming! Everyone was a new camper at one time, whether they came with a parent or friend or just thought PMC sounded great and came by themselves. We do our best to help new campers feel at home in our community. This year we’ll all be getting to know our new home at Camp Kintail together, so that’s fun!</li></ul><h3>The Money Stuff</h3><p><strong>Is there any financial assistance available?<br></strong>Yes. Information about our bursary funds, as well as guidance on how to apply, is available on the <a href="https://presbyterian-music-camp.github.io/website/register.html">registration</a> page.</p><p><strong>If you have a question that is not answered here, please email PMC at <a href="#INTERNAL_LINK#/post/null">presbyterianmusiccamp@gmail.com</a></strong>.</p><p> </p></div></div></body></html>
