So there’s LOTS to report in this summary, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>PMC 2022<br>\n<ul>\n<li>Theme</li>\n<li>Dates</li>\n<li>Fees</li>\n<li>Registration</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>50th Anniversary of PMC</li>\n<li>Photo Albums</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>PMC 2022</h2>\n<p>The <strong>theme</strong> for PMC 2022 is <em><strong>The Long and Dusty Road: Life as a Pilgrimage</strong></em>.</p>\n<p>PMC 2022 will be <strong>August 21-28</strong> at Camp Tamarack.</p>\n<p>We will be raising <strong>registration fees</strong> a bit this year. In the pre-pandemic times, PMC absorbed the cost of HST on your camp fees. Sadly, we are at a stage where we have to raise fees so that we can continue this practice. HST will still be included in your fees, and the new fees are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Adult early bird (until May 15): <strong>$500</strong></li>\n<li>Adult regular (May 16-June 28): $525</li>\n<li>Adult just-in-time (June 29 onwards): $550</li>\n<li>Youth (4-12) anytime: <strong>$300</strong> (There’s no increase for youth fees – it isn’t their fault the registration is delayed…)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Also note the <strong>change in dates</strong> for the second fee increase – to align with when we have to pay our installment to Tamarack.</p>\n<p><strong>Registration</strong> will open in early March, and we have no idea what to expect this year! It would REALLY help us if you could register early (well before the deadline!) to take advantage of the early bird fee, and to give us an idea of our numbers. We don’t want to cancel camp, but we need ~106 campers to break even, and we have to decide in June if camp can go ahead. If you want to come but can’t quite commit, talk to the registrar (Cathy Whiteside, <a href=\"mailto:pmcregistrar@gmail.com\">pmcregistrar@gmail.com</a>) so we know about you.</p>\n<h2>50 YEARS OF HARMONY</h2>\n<p>Hard to believe that PMC has been running for 50 years! We are planning some great things to mark this milestone, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Kitchen parties in the months leading up to camp – if you want to host a kitchen party (doesn’t have to be in your kitchen!), contact MJ at <a href=\"mailto:presbyterianmusiccamp@gmail.com\">presbyterianmusiccamp@gmail.com</a></li>\n<li>A history of camp</li>\n<li>A commissioned song</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It’s not too late to contribute your ideas for the celebration. Contact MJ at <a href=\"mailto:presbyterianmusiccamp@gmail.com\">presbyterianmusiccamp@gmail.com</a> with your suggestions.</p>\n<p>Part of this process includes sifting through a treasure trove if archival information – old brochures, photos, merchandise, other memorabilia. If you have something that fits here, contact MJ at <a href=\"mailto:presbyterianmusiccamp@gmail.com\">presbyterianmusiccamp@gmail.com</a>.</p>\n<h2>???</h2>\n<p>We have misplaced the photo albums. If you have them, or know where they are, send a message to Alison Cooper (<a href=\"mailto:m.alison.cooper@gmail.com\">m.alison.cooper@gmail.com</a>)</p>",
