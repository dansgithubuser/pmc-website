            "content_html": "<p>Camp will be presented from the evening of Sunday, August 22 through to Saturday, August 28.</p>\n<p>The theme of this year’s camp is: PMC Trinity; Faith, Hope and Love. This is how our co-dean, David Linderman, describes the theme:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In Paul’s letter to the Corinthians, he sends a very clear message. With both simplicity and brevity, he states that faith, hope, and love are, as he describes them, the choicest of graces. In this famous verse of Scripture, the words, often quoted at weddings, and printed, have hit a chord in the modern world. With this phrase, Paul wraps up this section explaining why godly, self-sacrificing love is required to fully express spiritual gifts. He concludes by mentioning love again with two other virtues often listed with it: faith and hope. Together, these three virtues \"abide\" or \"remain.\" They are eternal.</p>\n<p>Throughout this protracted time of COVID isolation we have all needed to lean on our faith, to find hope when others around us may have none, and to respond with love in a hardening world. As a community, when we are at camp (I mean on the ground, walking the dusty road camp) theses graces are in abundance. The camp experience we often find inexplicable, is a manifestation of, the synergy of the gathering of people in the name of Jesus Christ.</p>\n<p>During this 2021 virtual camp experience we hope you are able to reflect on the words of Paul. This is an opportunity to share how faith, hope, and love have played a part in our lives, how they have helped us with the challenge of a pandemic, and how we can make these graces the tenets of our future.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Our program of activities will be shared in the coming weeks. If you’d like a PMC sweatshirt or T-shirt please look for the email from Alison Cooper sent June 21st with the details – the deadline for ordering is July 11.</p>\n<p>To help cover our modest costs of preparing and presenting PMC Trinity, please consider making a goodwill offering of $10 per person or $20 per family. These goodwill offerings can be made by e-transfer to <a href=\"mailto:PMCTreasurer@gmail.com\">PMCTreasurer@gmail.com</a>.</p>\n<p>More to come...</p>",

We don’t know what the next 12 months holds for us, but we DO know that we are a community that can overcome great challenges together.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s ironic that it’s called Discord when a) it brought people together, and b) we are a harmonic, musical family. We might be in the land of paradox here… But despite the name, it seemed that the more people engaged with Discord, the more like PMC it felt. I hope you all felt those moments when it really felt like the camp we love.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After a well-deserved September off, the PMC Committee met via Zoom on October 17 to review Planet Music Camp, and start the process of planning for PMC 2021. The location and format of PMC 2021 is a big unknown right now, but the dates are set: August 22-29. So mark your calendars, because SOMETHING will happen.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The PMC Committee spent a lot of time reviewing our beta-version of the Constitution and our newly accepted Terms of Reference. The next summary will detail the changes for you.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response to overwhelming positive feedback, we are going to use Discord through the year. It will be updated soon.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And – breaking news – we are planning a Christmas celebration – watch Discord for details on how you can join in.</span></p>",
