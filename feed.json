Also covered are the events and workshops, and how they will work using these platforms.</p>\n<p>Remember that because this year is online, there's no requirement to take time off, no entry fee, no drive, no living in cabins, so it's a <em>great</em> year to invite your friends!</p>\n<div class=\"post__toc\">\n<h3>Table of Contents</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#mcetoc_1eeolg2s14\">Platforms</a>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#mcetoc_1eeombhjkb\">Zoom</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#mcetoc_1eeomblidc\">YouTube</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#mcetoc_1eeomksk8f\">Discord</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#mcetoc_1eeomcb4be\">Email and Website</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"#mcetoc_1eeolg2s15\">Security Policy</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#mcetoc_1eeolg2s16\">Schedule</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#mcetoc_1eeolg2s17\">Program Descriptions</a>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#mcetoc_1eeolh3qr8\">Evening Programs and Performances</a>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#mcetoc_1eep24hs80\">Ubi Caritas</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#mcetoc_1eep27hq71\">Campfire</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#mcetoc_1eep27hq72\">Live Band Karaoke</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#mcetoc_1eep290rk4\">Dance Party</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#mcetoc_1eep298qf5\">Variety House</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#mcetoc_1eep3he980\">Hymn to Freedom</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#mcetoc_1eep3hrsc1\">Show Choir</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"#mcetoc_1eeolh3qr9\">Workshops and Such</a>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#mcetoc_1eep27hq73\">Hang-Outs</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#mcetoc_1eergtbmp0\">Daily Prayer Message</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#mcetoc_1eep47noo0\">Holy Motion</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#mcetoc_1eep411ad2\">Craft of the Day</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#mcetoc_1eep486en1\">Photo Scavenger Hunt</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#mcetoc_1eep48jgl2\">Beginner Theory and Ear Training</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#mcetoc_1eep48p553\">Tuck</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#mcetoc_1eep490f04\">Classical Guitar</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#mcetoc_1eergufv81\">Worship</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#mcetoc_1eep4dp3p0\">Story Time</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#mcetoc_1eep4e8g51\">Songs for Youngsters</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#mcetoc_1eep4fc122\">Beatles for Banjo</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#mcetoc_1eep4fc122\">Social Stitching</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#mcetoc_1eep4g99i3\">Relaxation</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#mcetoc_1eep4gmk54\">Bible Study</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#mcetoc_1eep27hq73\">Preparing for Rehearsal</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1eeolg2s14\">Platforms</h2>\n<p>Please note that this section and the next (the Security Policy) go hand-in-hand.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1eeombhjkb\">Zoom</h3>\n<p>Soaring in popularity, Zoom hardly needs an intro. But just in case: Zoom is a video conferencing platform that offers superior features and quality to entirely-free options like Skype or Google Hangouts. You can use Zoom in your browser or download it <a href=\"https://zoom.us/support/download\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Zoom will be used for most of our workshops and events. Links to Zoom meetings will be posted in a variety of places: here, on Discord (see below), and in email. The password to those meetings will only be sent privately. The committee will mainly use email, but it's fine to use instant chat, text, and phone as well. Don't post passwords on social media.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1eeomblidc\">YouTube</h3>\n<p>Another artistic form taking off is one where performers separately record themselves and an editor composes each recording into a final product. The committee has given this a go already, and we plan to use this format for things like Ubi Caritas and our combination Variety Coffee Night House.</p>\n<p>The videos we post will be private. Links can be shared publicly, but the passwords must only be shared privately.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1eeomksk8f\">Discord</h3>\n<p>A little less well-known, Discord is a virtual hang-out space. If you're familiar with IRC or Slack, Discord should feel familiar. The unique thing about Discord and alternatives is that a group of people can organize themselves into \"channels\" and talk about various topics, without muddling each others' conversations. In our case, things like announcements, workshops, and evening programs.</p>\n<p>Given that Discord can be updated much more easily than this site, it's natural that Discord will have more accurate information. Think of Discord like the announcements you hear in the Dining Hall, and all the side conversations.</p>\n<p>Discord can be used in your browser or downloaded for desktop or mobile. Please use your real name so we know who you are!</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><a href=\"https://discord.gg/TBapR3w\">Claim your invite to the PMC server here!</a></p>\n<p>If Discord doesn't make sense at first, you can read our guide <a href=\"Discord for Planet Music Camp.pdf\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1eeomcb4be\">Email and Website</h3>\n<p>The PMC committee intends to communicate as usual via email and this website. Think of it like the announcement board in the dining hall, for people who slept in past breakfast.</p>\n<p>Please help us make sure your friends and family who want to be on the email list actually are!</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1eeolg2s15\">Security Policy</h2>\n<p>To protect the privacy of our community and to respect the guidelines for using copyright materials, participants in the online events of Planet Music Camp must follow these guidelines:</p>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li>Links to Planet Music Camp online events can be shared individually with family and friends; HOWEVER, links, pictures or videos must not be distributed broadly via email or posted on Facebook, Twitter, or other social media.</li>\n<li>Planet Music Camp videos will be presented on a private YouTube channel and will be password protected. Registrants will be provided with the password which they can share with family and friends on the understanding that the passwords cannot be shared further.</li>\n<li>If you choose to upload pictures, please get the permission of any people that can be identified in the pictures.</li>\n<li>Help us ensure we know who's watching by using your real name on the platforms we use.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1eeolg2s16\">Schedule</h2>\n<p>The schedule can be viewed <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1otNtGEhoV6QwSjQkMnQHDj_L68GXwvPO/view\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>!</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1eeolg2s17\">Program Descriptions</h2>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1eeolh3qr8\">Evening Programs and Performances</h3>\n<h4 id=\"mcetoc_1eep24hs80\">Ubi Caritas</h4>\n<p id=\"mcetoc_1eer2pec40\"><a href=\"https://discord.com/channels/724391210696966216/735603328448200707\">Discord</a></p>\n<p>What would Music Camp be without beginning and ending with Ubi Caritas? We would like to have as many people and families as possible record themselves on video (or just audio if you are shy) singing Ubi Caritas while holding your candle. Doug Kendall and Ian MacCready will put it all together into a video for us to use at the beginning and the end of Planet Music Camp 2020.</p>\n<p>Submissions due <strong>August 9th</strong>.</p>\n<p>A detailed description can be found <a href=\"Ubi_Caritas_for_PMC_2020.pdf\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Contact Doug at <a href=\"mailto:rev.doug@me.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">rev.doug@me.com</a> for any questions.</p>\n<h4 id=\"mcetoc_1eep27hq71\">Campfire</h4>\n<p id=\"mcetoc_1eer2po111\"><a href=\"https://discord.com/channels/724391210696966216/734167745826127893\">Discord</a></p>\n<p>Campfire this year is hosted by Alison Cooper. The good/bad news is there is NO pre-recording for you to do. We will be totally LIVE on Zoom, with no second takes.</p>\n<p>Here’s how it will work:</p>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li>There’ll be a list of performers on Discord so you have a rough idea of when you’re \"on\".</li>\n<li>Alison announces when you are up next.</li>\n<li>Alison turns your mic on - everyone else is muted.</li>\n<li>You lead your song - everyone sings along at home.\n<ul>\n<li>If your song is a round, or is a \"call-repeat\", or has actions, it will help if you have someone(s) physically with you to do each part, or repeat, or do actions.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>When you are done there is wild applause.</li>\n</ul>\n<div> </div>\n</div>\n<div>If you are willing to be on the program to share a campfire song, please let Alison know by <strong>August 23rd</strong>.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>There may be some young people who want to participate.

No? Well they exist and they are a unique vibe that has sprung up during COVID! The vibe is a lot like the all-ages dance in the dining-hall: a bunch of people dancing and a bunch of people watching. With Zoom, different people will be \"spotlighted\" for others to watch. The focus shifts from person to person, controlled by the host, for you to show your moves to the rest of the participants! The host keeps an eye out for who's ready to show what they've got next. We'll take live song requests, but feel free to post some suggestions on Discord ahead of time!</p>\n<h4 id=\"mcetoc_1eep298qf5\">Variety House</h4>\n<p id=\"mcetoc_1eer2qald4\"><a href=\"https://discord.com/channels/724391210696966216/735603840027721819\">Discord</a></p>\n<p>Planet Music Camp will be premiering PMC’s first digitally mastered Variety House (Variety Night / Coffee House)!
