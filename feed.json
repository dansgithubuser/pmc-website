They confirmed this decision on the 19th of November.</p>\n<p>On hearing the initial news, the PMC board struck a subcommittee to start a new site search. In the weeks between learning Camp Tamarack’s intentions and their ultimate decision, the subcommittee reviewed the Ontario Camp Association list of camps that rent their facility and screened out the ones that clearly wouldn’t work. From that list of almost 100 camps, the subcommittee identified 22 camps that looked like they might be able to accommodate our program and that didn’t have an obvious conflict with dates. After getting the confirmation that Camp Tamarack would not be available to us, the subcommittee members split up the list and held phone interviews with each camp. From that list of 22, only two camps were viable candidates.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\">After visiting both sites in early December 2022, and carefully considering their abilities to meet our needs and support our program, the subcommittee put forward a recommendation to pursue contracting with Camp Kintail for 2023. On Saturday December 17, 2022, the PMC Board met and voted to accept that recommendation.</span></p>\n<p>Camp Kintail is a very <span style=\"color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\">active camp and conference facility that operates 10 months of the year, focusing on children’s and family camps in the summer and hosting groups with diverse interests throughout the year. The camp executive director, Johnathon Lee, is very familiar with PMC through his Presbyterian Church connections and through personal connections to current and former campers. The Camp Kintail organization is delighted to be hosting PMC and building a long-term relationship. The site is beautiful, the buildings are updated and well-kept. The chef at Camp Kintail has an excellent reputation. There are excellent accommodations, workshop facilities and outdoor gathering places that will support our camp’s program and community needs. Great care has been taken to make every area of the site and buildings accessible. It’s also important to acknowledge that Camp Kintail’s connection to the Presbyterian Church, and the obvious support that it receives from its community and Synod will be a strong foundation for a long-term relationship.</span></p>\n<p>Ian MacCready has prepared a really good <a href=\"https://ln5.sync.com/dl/cd8526b40/scw5zwd8-fa9ghd8g-qx6xk4xz-xxijxv39\">pictorial tour of Camp Kintail</a> which you can see by clicking the link. Ian has organized the photos in folders that identify the pictures with the landmarks on the site map that’s in the root directory. Please note that the map is more of an artist’s rendition, but it certainly gives you a good sense of the features of the site.</p>\n<p>The PMC board is confident that the choice of Kintail is the right one and is determined to help mitigate the inconvenience for those that have to travel a longer distance to get to camp. </p>",

We are pulling out all the stops to make this an in-person, face-to-face, real live camp, because 2022 is the <a href=\"https://presbyterian-music-camp.github.io/website/50-years-of-harmony.html\">50th anniversary</a> of PMC!<br><br>The theme of PMC 2022 theme is:</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><em>The Long and Dusty Road: Life as a Pilgrimage</em></p>\n<p>We would appreciate if you <a href=\"https://presbyterian-music-camp.github.io/website/register.html\">register</a> sooner rather than later to give us an idea of numbers. Read on for everything we know so far that might help you decide if you can come this year or not. If you want to come but can’t quite commit, please email the registrar (Cathy Whiteside, <a href=\"mailto:pmcregistrar@gmail.com\">pmcregistrar@gmail.com</a>) so we know about you.</p>\n<p>Vaccination for Covid-19 will be required for those aged 6 and up to attend PMC in 2022, except for those with medical exemptions. <span style=\"color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\">We have made this decision so that we can provide a camp and program you are used to, and to protect our community, particularly those who cannot be vaccinated yet.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\">A vaccine is now available for children age 5 and under. A first dose is strongly encouraged, but is <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">not</span> required (as it may not be possible for parents to schedule this before camp).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Visitors to PMC</strong></span></p>\n<p>As of June 23, we WILL be allowing visits to PMC. There are a few restrictions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Visitors must be fully vaccinated, following the requirements for all campers;</li>\n<li>Avoid activities that might expose you to Covid in the week leading up to the visit;</li>\n<li>Take a rapid test 5 days before the visit and again the day of the visit;</li>\n<li>Plan to stay on site for the duration of your visit. (Leaving is discouraged, as it is for all campers.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Contact the registrar (Cathy Whiteside, <a href=\"mailto:pmcregistrar@gmail.com\">pmcregistrar@gmail.com</a>), to make arrangements for your visit, especially if you will need accommodation, as space is limited.</p>\n<p>If possible, arrange to come on Saturday, so you can hear the concert, eat a delicious lunch, enjoy the birthday party, and spend your savings on the auction!</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">This Year's Schedule</span></p>\n<p>The schedule is almost done; you can find the almost final version <a href=\"https://presbyterian-music-camp.github.io/website/pmc week schedule 2022_combined_Aug10.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>.
