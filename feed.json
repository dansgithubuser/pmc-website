PMC is seen by many as the end of one year and the start of the next. You may be feeling angry), incredulous), or even a bit depressed. The PMC Committee shares these feelings (and many more), and we are still working on accepting that “camp” will be a different sort of experience this year.</p>\n<p>However…there is a silver lining:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Our friends at Camp Tamarack (Rick, Ellen, and Marc) are optimistic that they will<br>survive and thrive, and they are looking forward to hosting us again in 2021.</li>\n<li>The PMC Committee will continue to work on the administrative issues (constitution,<br>charitable status, emergency procedures, and more) so we will be in great shape for<br>camp in 2021.</li>\n<li>We have started thinking about some virtual activities for 2020 to keep our community<br>engaged and active.

We are going to redesign the website and update the content to make it more attractive to and informative for potential new campers. <strong>Daniel Eisner</strong> will be leading this, with content help from <strong>Rae-Lyn Rosefield</strong>, <strong>Kaitlin Audet</strong>, <strong>Cynthia McMinn</strong>, <strong>Bradley Audet</strong>, and <strong>Lindsay Weidelich</strong>.</p>\n<p>We also discussed and approved a financial incentive for new campers – ½ price camp! There are some limits and conditions for this, but we wanted to tell you early so you can persuade your family and friends to think about coming to camp in 2020. More information will follow.</p>\n<p><strong>Vic Lovatt</strong> has joined us as youth rep, <strong>Sarah Dupont</strong> is continuing work on scripts for promotional videos, and <strong>Anne Audet</strong> is looking into solving a cross-contamination issue for campers with food allergies/sensitivites.</p>\n<p>Of course, we also discussed some more mundane things, like insurance,<br>safety plan, and the budget. Someone has to.</p>\n<p>Finally, there is a great idea for fundraising in the works. Stay tuned for details of this – you won’t want to miss it.</p>",

After each committee meeting, we’ll send a brief summary to our camp community so you can see what we’re up to.</p>\n<p>We had our first committee meeting on September 28. We welcomed several new PMC Committee members, and said thanks and farewell to a few others. Special thanks to our outgoing Deans, <strong>Sue Thompson</strong> and <strong>Kim Lovatt</strong>, and to our outgoing Convener <strong>Ruth Anne Robertson</strong>, as they transition to other (just as demanding) roles in their lives.</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>Mark your calendars!! Camp in 2020 will be August 23-30.</strong></p>\n<p>Welcome to <strong>David Linderman</strong> and <strong>Hugh Donnelly</strong> as Deans for 2020 and 2021. They have some great theme ideas – we’ll update you soon.</p>\n<p>The <strong>PMC Committee</strong> for 2019-2020 is:<br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Conveners</span>: Taras Broadhead and Cynthia McMinn<br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Treasurer</span>: Debi Vanderstelt<br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Secretary</span>: Alison Cooper<br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Registrar</span>: Cathy Whiteside<br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Merchandise</span>: Cathy Whiteside<br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Staffing</span>: Jesse Fegelman and Kim Lovatt<br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Advertising</span>: TBC<br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Website</span>: Daniel Eisner<br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Camp Liaison</span>: Anne Audet<br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Teen</span> Rep: Lisa Broadhead<br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Cairn Reps</span>: MJ Perry, Doug Kendall</p>\n<p>Among the many things we talked about at the meeting were these highlights:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Planning is underway for new promotional videos for PMC, to use for introducing PMC to new campers. Sarah Dupont is working on scripts.</li>\n<li>An improved agreement for <strong>sharing the Tamarack site</strong> with Camp Tournesol (the French camp); we are working on a plan to implement an improved agreement in 2020.</li>\n<li>The future and role of <strong>Coffee House</strong>; we will consider this further as we plan for 2020.</li>\n<li>We have the <strong>banner</strong> to fix over the winter (repairing the Great Mousecapade); Ian MacCready has the parts to fix the banner stand.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Want to make a joyful noise over the winter?
