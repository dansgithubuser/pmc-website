It also spells out how many Directors we need for a quorum, the rules for calling meetings, and voting at meetings. This will provide a structure for decision-making, particularly when there are challenging decisions on the table.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What stays the same?</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pretty much everything else – our Mission Statement; what you see, hear and feel at camp; our community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your PMC Board</span></p>",

I hope you all felt those moments when it really felt like the camp we love.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After a well-deserved September off, the PMC Committee met via Zoom on October 17 to review Planet Music Camp, and start the process of planning for PMC 2021. The location and format of PMC 2021 is a big unknown right now, but the dates are set: August 22-29. So mark your calendars, because SOMETHING will happen.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The PMC Committee spent a lot of time reviewing our beta-version of the Constitution and our newly accepted Terms of Reference.

But just in case: Zoom is a video conferencing platform that offers superior features and quality to entirely-free options like Skype or Google Hangouts. You can use Zoom in your browser or download it <a href=\"https://zoom.us/support/download\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Zoom will be used for most of our workshops and events. Links to Zoom meetings will be posted in a variety of places: here, on Discord (see below), and in email. The password to those meetings will only be sent privately. The committee will mainly use email, but it's fine to use instant chat, text, and phone as well. Don't post passwords on social media.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1eeomblidc\">YouTube</h3>\n<p>Another artistic form taking off is one where performers separately record themselves and an editor composes each recording into a final product. The committee has given this a go already, and we plan to use this format for things like Ubi Caritas and our combination Variety Coffee Night House.</p>\n<p>The videos we post will be private. Links can be shared publicly, but the passwords must only be shared privately.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1eeomksk8f\">Discord</h3>\n<p>A little less well-known, Discord is a virtual hang-out space. If you're familiar with IRC or Slack, Discord should feel familiar. The unique thing about Discord and alternatives is that a group of people can organize themselves into \"channels\" and talk about various topics, without muddling each others' conversations. In our case, things like announcements, workshops, and evening programs.</p>\n<p>Given that Discord can be updated much more easily than this site, it's natural that Discord will have more accurate information. Think of Discord like the announcements you hear in the Dining Hall, and all the side conversations.</p>\n<p>Discord can be used in your browser or downloaded for desktop or mobile. Please use your real name so we know who you are!</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><a href=\"https://discord.gg/6HfAjxw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Claim your invite to the PMC server here!</a></p>\n<p>If Discord doesn't make sense at first, you can read our guide <a href=\"Discord for Planet Music Camp.pdf\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1eeomcb4be\">Email and Website</h3>\n<p>The PMC committee intends to communicate as usual via email and this website.

No? Well they exist and they are a unique vibe that has sprung up during COVID! The vibe is a lot like the all-ages dance in the dining-hall: a bunch of people dancing and a bunch of people watching. With Zoom, different people will be \"spotlighted\" for others to watch. The focus shifts from person to person, controlled by the host, for you to show your moves to the rest of the participants! The host keeps an eye out for who's ready to show what they've got next. We'll take live song requests, but feel free to post some suggestions on Discord ahead of time!</p>\n<h4 id=\"mcetoc_1eep298qf5\">Variety House</h4>\n<p id=\"mcetoc_1eer2qald4\"><a href=\"https://discord.com/channels/724391210696966216/735603840027721819\">Discord</a></p>\n<p>Planet Music Camp will be premiering PMC’s first digitally mastered Variety House (Variety Night / Coffee House)!
